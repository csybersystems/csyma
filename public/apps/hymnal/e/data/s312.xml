		<verse>
			Jesus, keep me near the cross;
			there a precious fountain,
			free to all, a healing stream,
			flows from Calvary's mountain.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			In the cross, in the cross,
			be my glory ever,
			till my raptured soul shall find
			rest beyond the river.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Near the cross, a trembling soul,
			love and mercy found me;
			there the bright and morning star
			sheds its beams around me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
			bring its scenes before me;
			help me walk from day to day
			with its shadow o'er me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
			hoping, trusting ever,
			till I reach the golden strand
			just beyond the river.
		</verse>
