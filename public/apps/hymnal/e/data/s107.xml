	<verses>
		<verse>
			God moves in a mysterious way
			His wonders to perform;
			He plants His footsteps in the sea,
			And rides upon the storm.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
			The clouds ye so much dread
			Are big with mercy, and shall break
			In blessings on your head.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
			But trust Him for His grace;
			Behind a frowning providence
			He hides a smiling face.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His purposes will ripen fast,
			Unfolding every hour;
			The bud may have a bitter taste,
			But sweet will be the flower.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Blind unbelief is sure to err,
			And scan His work in vain;
			God is His own interpreter,
			And He will make it plain.
		</verse>
