		<verse>
			Christ is coming! let creation
			Bid her groans and travail cease;
			Let the glorious proclamation
			Hope restore and faith increase;
			Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
			Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!
			Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Earth can now but tell the story
			Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
			She shall yet behold Thy glory
			When Thou comest back to reign;
			Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
			Let each heart repeat the strain.
			Let each heart repeat the strain.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With that blessed hope before us,
			Let no harp remain unstrung;
			Let the mighty advent chorus
			Onward roll from tongue to tongue:
			Christ is coming! Christ is soling!
			Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
			Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
		</verse>
