		<verse>
			The Lord in Zion reigneth, let all the world rejoice,
			And come before His throne of grace with tuneful heart and voice;
			The Lord in Zion reigneth, and there His praise shall ring,
			To Him shall princes bend the knee and kings their glory bring.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord in Zion reigneth, and who so great as He?
			The depths of earth are in His hands; He rules the mighty sea.
			O crown His Name with honor, and let His standard wave,
			Till distant isles beyond the deep shall own His power to save.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord in Zion reigneth, these hours to Him belong;
			O enter now His temple gates, and fill His courts with song;
			Beneath His royal banner let every creature fall,
			Exalt the King of heaven and earth, and crown Him Lord of all
		</verse>
