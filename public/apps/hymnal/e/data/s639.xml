		<verse>
			A diligent and grateful heart
			Prompts me to sing Thy praise.
			Thy love and mercies from the start
			Have blessed me all my days.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I thank Thee for the means to serve
			With talents and with tithes,
			For sharing brings the utmost joy
			When lifting other lives.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My thanks I give for stewardship
			To minister through deeds,
			To serve and share with patient care
			Thy people in their needs.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Lord, I dedicate my all
			In this response to Thee.
			Help me to magnify this call
			In deep humility.
