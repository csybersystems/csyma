	<verses>
		<verse>
			O for a faith that will not shrink,
			Though pressed by many a foe,
			That will not tremble on the brink of peverty
			Of poverty or woe, of poverty or woe.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			That will not murmur or complain
			Beneath the chast'ning rod,
			But in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain,
			Can lean upon its God, Can lean upon its God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A faith that shines more bright and clear
			When tempests rage without;
			That when in danger knows no fear, knows of no fear
			In darkness feels no doubt! In darkness feels no doubt!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			That bears unmoved the world's dread frown,
			Nor heeds its scornful smile;
			That sins wild ocean cannot drown, No, cannot drown
			Nor its soft arts beguile, Nor its soft arts beguile
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, give me such a faith as this;
			And then, whate'er may come,
			I'll taste e'en here the hallowed bliss, the hallowed bliss
			Of an eternal home, of an eternal home.
		</verse>
