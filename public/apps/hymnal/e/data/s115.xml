		<verse>
			O come, O come, Immanuel,
			And ransom captive Israel
			That mourns in lonely exile here
			Until the Son of God appear.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel
			Shall come to thee, O Israel!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
			And order all things, far and nigh;
			To us the path of knowledge show,
			And cause us in her ways to go.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O come, Desire of nations, bind
			All peoples in one heart and mind;
			Bid envy, strife, and quarrels cease;
			Fill the whole world with heaven's peace.
		</verse>
