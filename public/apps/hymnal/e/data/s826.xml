			Love the Lord your God
			with all your heart
			and with all your soul
			and with all your strength.

		<verse>
			These commandments that I give you today
			are to be upon your hearts.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Impress them on your children.
			Talk about them when you sit at home
			and when you walk along the road,
			when you lie down and when you get up.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Children, obey your parents in the Lord,
			for this is right.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Honor your father and mother"
			which is the first commandment with a promise
			"that it may go well with you
			and that you may enjoy long life on the earth."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Fathers, do not exasperate your children;
			instead, bring them up in the training
			and instruction of the Lord.
