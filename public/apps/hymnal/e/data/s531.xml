		<refrain>
			We'll build               on the Rock,
			  We'll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,
			We'll build               on the Rock;
			  We'll build on the Rock,on the solid Rock;
			We'll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,
			On Christ, the mighty Rock.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			We'll build on the Rock, the living Rock,
			On Jesus, the rock of Ages;
			So shall we abide the fearful shock,
			When loud the tempest rages.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Some build on the sinking sands of life,
			On visions of earthly treasure;
			Some build on the waves of sinful strife,
			Of fame, and worldly pleasure.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O build on the Rock forever sure,
			The firm and the true foundation;
			Its hope is the hope which shall endure,
			The hope of our salvation.
		</verse>
