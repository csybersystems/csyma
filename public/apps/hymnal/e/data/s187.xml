	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus! what a Friend for sinners!
			Jesus! Lover of my soul;
			Friends may fail me, foes assail me,
			He, my Savior, makes me whole.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Hallelujah! what a Savior!
			Hallelujah! what a Friend!
			Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
			He is with me to the end.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Jesus! what a Strength for weakness!
			Let me hide myself in Him;
			Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing,
			He, my Strength, my vict'ry wins.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus! what a Help in sorrow!
			While the billows o'er me roll,
			Even when my heart is breaking,
			He, my Comfort, helps my soul.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus! I do now receive Him,
			More than all in Him I find,
			He hath granted me forgiveness,
			I am His, and He is mine.
		</verse>
