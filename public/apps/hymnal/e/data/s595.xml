	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Then trim your lamps, my brethren dear,
			Then trim your lamps with godly fear;
			The Master's coming draweth near,
			Let every lamp be burning.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Let every lamp be burning bright,
			The darkest hour is nearing;
			The darkest hour of earth's long night,
			Before the Lord's appearing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though thousands calmly slumber on,
			The last great message spuring,
			We'll rest our living faith upon
			His promise of returning.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then let good works with faith appear,
			To help the world around us;
			Obedience bring the blessing near 
			When faith has firmly bound us.
		</verse>
