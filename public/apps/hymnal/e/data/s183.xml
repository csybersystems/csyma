	<verses>
		<verse>
			I Will sing of Jesus love,
			Sing of Him,who first loved me;
			for He left bright worlds above,
			And died on Calvary.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			I will sing of Jesus love
			Endless praise my heart shall give;
			He has died that I might live
			I will sing His love to me.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			O the depths of love divine!
			Earth or heaven can never know
			How that sin as dark as mine
			can be made as white as snow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Nothing good for Him I've done;
			How could He such love bestow?
			Lord, I own my heart is won,
			help me now my love to show.
		</verse>
