		<refrain>
			I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
			I can not bear these burdens alone;
			I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
			Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I must tell Jesus all of my trials;
			I can not bear these burdens alone,
			In my distress He kindly will help me,
			He ever loves and cares for His own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I must tell Jesus all of my troubles,
			He is a kind, compassionate Friend;
			If I but ask Him, He will deliver,
			Makes of my troubles quickly an end.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O how the world to evil allures me!
			O how my heart is tempted to sin!
			I must tell Jesus, and He will tell me
			Over the world the vict'ry to win.
		</verse>
