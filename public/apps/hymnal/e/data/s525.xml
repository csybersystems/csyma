	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Hiding in Thee, Hiding in Thee,
			Thou blest Rock of Ages,
			I'm hiding in Thee.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
			My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
			So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine would I be;
			Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour,
			In times when temptation casts o'er me its pow'r;
			In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,
			Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,
			I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe;
			How often, when trials like sea-billows roll,
			Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.
		</verse>
