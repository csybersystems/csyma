		<verse>
			May God be with you Till we meet again,
			May God be with you, Keep you safe till then;
			And may His blessings Be within your heart,
			May God be with you While we're apart,
			May God be with you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May god be with you, Watch you from above,
			May God protect you In His tender love;
			And with the dawning Of each bright, new day,
			May God be with you, To guide your way,
			May God be with you.
