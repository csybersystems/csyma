	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, Your blood and righteousness
			My beauty are, my glorious dress;
			Mid flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
			With joy shall I lift up my head.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Bold shall I stand in that great day,
			Cleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;
			For by Your cross, absolved I am
			From sin and guilt, from fear and shame.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, I believe Your precious blood,
			Which at the mercy seat of God
			Pleads for the captives'liberty,
			Was also shed in love for me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When from the dust of death I rise
			To claim my mansion in the skies,
			This then shall be my only plea:
			Christ Jesus lived and died for me.
		</verse>
