	<eTitle>As Jacob With Travel Was Weary</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,
			And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,
			And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			As Jacob with travel was weary one day,
			At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;
			He saw in a vision a ladder so high
			That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come let us ascend! All may climb it who will;
			For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:
			And remember each step that by faith we passo'er,
			Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And when we arrive at the haven of rest
			We shall hear the glad words, "Come up hither, ye blest,
			Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss."
			O who would not climb such a ladder as this?
		</verse>
