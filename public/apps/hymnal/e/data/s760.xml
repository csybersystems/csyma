		<verse>
			In the beginning God created the
			heavens and the earth....'
			God saw all that he had made,
			and it was very good.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the beginning was the Word,
			and the Word was with God,
			and the Word was God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In him was life,
			and that life was the light of men.
			The Word became flesh'
			and lived for a while among us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We have seen his glory,
			the glory of the one and only Son,
			who came from the Father,
			full of grace and truth.
			All have sinned and fall
			short of the glory of God,
			and are justified freely
			by his grace through the redemption
			that came by Christ Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
			he is a new creation;
			the old has gone, the new has come!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Behold, I will create
			new heavens and a new earth.
			Be glad and rejoice forever
			in what I will create."
