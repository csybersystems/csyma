	<eTitle>HOPE AND COMFORT -- Isaiah 41, Psalm 33, and Romans 5, 15, Jerusalem</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Do not be afraid, for I am with you;
			stop being anxious and watchful,
			for I am your God.
			I give you strength, I bring you help,
			I uphold you with my victorious right hand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him,
			on those who rely on his love,
			to rescue their souls from death
			and keep them alive in famine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It is by faith and through Jesus that we have
			entered this state of grace in which we
			can boast about looking forward to God's glory.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But that is not all we can boast about;
			we can boast about our sufferings.
			These sufferings bring patience, as we know,
			and patience brings perseverance,
			and perseverance brings hope,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			and this hope is not deceptive,
			because the love of God has been
			poured into our hearts by the
			Holy Spirit which has been given us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May the God of hope bring you such joy and peace
			in your faith that the power of the Holy Spirit
			will remove all bounds to hope.
		</verse>
