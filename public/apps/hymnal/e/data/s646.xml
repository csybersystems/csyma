	<verses>
		<verse>
			To the name that brings salvation
			Let the nations bow the head;
			Let them kneel in adoration
			When this name of names is said; 
			Let them pray for restoration
			Of all things in Christ the head.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He through every generation
			Rules in endless majesty;
			May the kings of every nation
			Now foreswear their enmity,
			And with humble veneration
			In the love of God agree.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, we pray for upright rulers:
			Guard them surely in their need
			From the vanity of power
			And the emptiness of greed;
			Let them see the truth of lowness,
			And on justice let them feed.
		</verse>
