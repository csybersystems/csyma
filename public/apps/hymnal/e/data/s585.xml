	<eTitle>When Christ Was Lifted From the Earth</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			When Christ was lifted from the earth
			His arms stretched out above
			Through every culture, every birth,
			To draw an answering love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Still east and west His love extends
			And always, near or far,
			He calls and claims us as His friends
			And love us as we are.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Where generation, class or race
			Divides us to our shame
			He sees not labels but a face,
			A person and a name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thus freely loved, tho' fully known
			May I in Christ be free
			To welcome and accept
			His own as Christ accepted me.
		</verse>
