	<verses>
		<verse>
			Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish.
			come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel.
			Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
			earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,
			hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure!
			Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,
			"Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Here see the bread of life; waters flowing
			forth from the throne of God, pure from above.
			Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing
			earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.
		</verse>
