	<verses>
		<verse>
			There's a wideness in God's mercy,
			Like the wideness of the sea;
			There's a kindness in His justice,
			Which is more than liberty.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There is welcome for the sinner,
			And more graces for the good;
			There is mercy with the Savior;
			There is healing in His blood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the love of God is broader
			Than the measure of man's mind,
			And the heart of the Eternal
			Is most wonder fully kind.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If our love were but more simple,
			We should take Him at His word;
			And our lives would be all sunshine
			In the sweetness of our Lord.
		</verse>
