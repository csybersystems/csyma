	<verses>
		<verse>
			The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended;
			the darkness falls at Thy behest;
			to Thee our morning hymns ascended;
			Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping
			while earth rolls onward into light,
			through all the world her watch is keeping,
			and rests not now by day or night.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As o'er each continent and island
			the dawn leads on another day,
			the voice of prayer is never silent,
			nor die the strains of praise away.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,
			like earth's proud empires, pass away.
			Thy kingdom stands, and grows forever,
			till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.
		</verse>
