		<verse>
			All things are Thine; no gift have we,
			Lord of all gifts, to offer Thee;
			And hence with grateful hearts today,
			Thine own before Thy feet we lay.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thy will was in the builder's thought;
			Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;
			Thro' mortal motive, scheme and plan,
			Thy wise, eternal purpose ran.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			No lack Thy perfect fullness knew;
			For human needs and longings grew
			This house of prayer- this home of rest.
			Here may Thy saints be often blessed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In weakness and in want we call
			On Thee, for whom the heav'ns are small;
			Thy glory is Thy children's good,
			Thy joy Thy tender Fatherhood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Father! deign these walls to bless;
			Make this the abode of righteousness,
			And let these doors a gateway be
			To lead us from ourselves to Thee!
		</verse>
