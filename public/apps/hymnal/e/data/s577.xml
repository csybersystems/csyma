	<verses>
		<verse>
			In the heart of Jesus there is love for you,
			Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;
			Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,
			When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you,
			Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;
			Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,
			Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the fields of Jesus there is work for you;
			Such as even angels might rejoice to do;
			Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand,
			While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the home of Jesus there's a place for you;
			Glorious, bright, and joyous, calm and peaceful too;
			Why then, like a wanderer, Roam with weary pace,
			If the home of Jesus holds for you a place?
		</verse>
