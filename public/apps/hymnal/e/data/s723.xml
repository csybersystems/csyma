	<eTitle>O GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD, FOR HE IS GOOD -- Psalm 107, RSV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
			for his steadfast love endures for ever!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
			whom be bas redeemed from trouble
			and gathered in from the lands,
			from the east and from the west,
			from the north and from the south.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Some wandered in desert wastes,
			finding no way to a city to dwell in;
			hungry and thirsty,
			their soul fainted within them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
			and be delivered them from their distress;
			be led them by a straight way,
			till they reached a city to dwell in.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
			for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
			For he satisfies him who is thirsty,
			and the hungry he fills with good things.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Some sat in darkness and in gloom,
			prisoners in affliction and in irons,
			for they bad rebelled against the words of God,
			and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Their hearts were bowed down with hard labor;
			they fell down, with none to help.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
			and he delivered them from their distress;
			he brought them out of darkness and gloom,
			and broke their bonds asunder.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
			for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
		</verse>
