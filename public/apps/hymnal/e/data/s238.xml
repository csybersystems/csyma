	<verses>
		<verse>
			How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
			In a believer's ear!
			It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
			And drives away his fear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It makes the wounded spirit whole,
			And calms the troubled breast;
			"Tis manna to the hungry soul,
			And to the weary, rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Dear name, the rock on which I build,
			My shield and hiding place,
			My neverfailing treasury, filled
			With boundless stores of grace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus! my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,
			My Prophet, Priest, and King!
			My Lord, my life, my way, my end!
			Accept the praise I bring.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Weak is the effort of my heart,
			And cold my warmest thought;
			But when I see Thee as Thou art,
			I'll praise Thee as I ought.
		</verse>
