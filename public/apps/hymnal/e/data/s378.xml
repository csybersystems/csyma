		<verse>
			"Go, preach My gospel," saith the Lord;
			"Bid the whole world My grace receive;
			He shall be saved who trusts My word,
			And they condemned who disbelieve.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I'll make your great commission known,
			And ye shall prove My gospel true
			By all the works that I have done,
			By all the wonders ye shall do.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Teach all the nations My commands;
			I'm with you till the world shall end;
			All power is vested in My hands;
			I can destroy, and I defend."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He spake, and light shone round His head;
			On a bright cloud to heaven He rode;
			They to the farthest nations spread
			The grace of their ascended Lord.
		</verse>
