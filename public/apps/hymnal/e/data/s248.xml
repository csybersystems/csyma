	<verses>
		<verse>
			There is a name I love to hear,
			I love to sing its worth;
			It sounds like music in my ear,
			The sweetest name on earth.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			O, how I love Jesus,
			O, how I love Jesus,
			O, how I love Jesus-
			Because He first loved me!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			It tells me of a Savior's love,
			Who died to set me free;
			It tells me of His precious blood,
			The sinner's perfect plea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It tells of One whose loving heart
			Can feel my deepest woe,
			Who in each sorrow bears a part
			That none can bear below.
		</verse>
