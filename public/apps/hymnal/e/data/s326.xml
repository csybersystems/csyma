		<verse>
			Open my eyes, that I may see
			Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
			Place in my hands the wonderful key
			That shall unclasp and set me free.
			Silently now I wait for Thee,
			Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
			Open my eyes, illumine me, Spirit Divine!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Open my ears that I may hear
			Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
			and while the wavenotes fall on my ear,
			Everything false will disappear.
			Silently now I wait for Thee,
			Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
			Open my ears, illumine me, Spirit Divine!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Open my mouth, and let me bear
			Gladly the warm truth everywhere;
			Open my heart, and let me prepare
			Love with Thy children thus to share.
			Silently now I wait for Thee,
			Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
			Open my heart, illumine me, Spirit Divine!
		</verse>
