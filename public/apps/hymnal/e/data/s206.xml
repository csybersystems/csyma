		<verse>
			Face to face with Christ my Savior,
			Face to face, what will it be,
			When with rapture I behold Him,
			Jesus Christ, who died for me?
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Face to face shall I behold Him,
			Far beyond the starry sky;
			Face to face in all His glory
			I shall see Him by and by!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Only faintly now I see Him,
			With the darkening veil between,
			But a blessed day is coming,
			When His glory shall be seen.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What rejoicing in His presence,
			When are banished grief and pain;
			When the crooked ways are straightened,
			And the dark things shall be plain!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Face to face! oh, blissful moment!
			Face to face to see and know;
			Face to face with my Redeemer,
			Jesus Christ, who loves me so.
		</verse>
