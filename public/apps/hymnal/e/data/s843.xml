	<verses>
		<verse>
			He is the image of the invisible God,
			the first-born of all creation;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			for in him all things were created,
			in heaven and on earth,
			visible and invisible,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			whether thrones or dominions
			or principalities or authorities
			all things were created through him
			and for him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He is before all things,
			and in him all things hold together.
			He is the head of the body, the church;
			he is the beginning,
			the first-born from the dead,
			that in everything he might be pre-eminent.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For in him all the fulness of God
			was pleased to dwell,	
			and through him to reconcile to himself all things,
			whether on earth or in heaven,
			making peace by the blood of his cross.
		</verse>
