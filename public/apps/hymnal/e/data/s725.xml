	<eTitle>GOD WORKS FOR GOOD -- Romans 8, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			I consider that our present sufferings
			are not worth comparing	with the glory
			that will be revealed in us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The creation waits in eager expectation
			for the sons of God to be revealed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the creation was subjected to frustration,
			not by its own choice,
			but by the will of the one who subjected it,
			in hope that the creation itself
			will be liberated from its bondage to decay
			and brought into the glorious freedom
			of the children of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And we know that in all things
			God works for me good
			of those who love him,
			who have been called
			according to his purpose.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What, then, shall we say in response to this?
			If God is for us, who can be against us?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He who did not spare his own Son,
			but gave him up for us all--
			how will he not also, along	with him,
			graciously give us all things?
		</verse>
