	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, with Thy church abide;
			Be her Savior, Lord, and Guide,
			While on earth her faith is tried:
			We beseech Thee, hear us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May her voice be ever clear,
			Warning of a judgment near,
			Telling of a Savior dear:
			We beseech Thee, hear us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May she guide the poor and blind,
			Seek the lost until she find,
			And the broken hearted bind:
			We beseech Thee, hear us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May she holy triumps win,
			Overthrow the hosts of sin,
			Gather all the nations in:
			We beseech Thee, hear us.
		</verse>
