		<verse>
			All people that on earth do dwell,
			sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
			Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell;
			come ye before him and rejoice.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Know that the Lord is God indeed;
			without our aid he did us make;
			we are his folk, he doth us feed,
			and for his sheep he doth us take.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O enter then his gates with praise;
			approach with joy his courts unto;
			praise, laud, and bless his name always,
			for it is seemly so to do.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For why! the Lord our God is good;
			his mercy is forever sure;
			his truth at all times firmly stood,
			and shall from age to age endure.
		</verse>
