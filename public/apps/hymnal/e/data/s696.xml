	<eTitle>I WILL EXTOL THE LORD -- Psalm 34, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			I will extol the Lord at all times;
			his praise will always be on my lips.
			My soul will boast in the Lord;
			let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
			Glorify the Lord with me;
			let us exalt his name together.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I sought the Lord, and he answered me;
			He delivered me from all my fears.
			Those who look to him are radiant; 
			their faces are never covered with shame.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This poor man called, and the Lord heard him;
			he saved him out of all his troubles 
			The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,
			And he delivers them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Taste and see that the Lord is good; 
			blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
			Fear the Lord, you his saints,
			for those who fear him lack nothing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them;
			He delivers them from all their troubles.
			The Lord is close to the broken hearted
			And saves those who are crushed in spirit.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Evil will slay the wicked;
			The foes of the righteous will be condemned.
			The Lord Redeems his servants; 
			No one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.
		</verse>
