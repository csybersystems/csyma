			But if the salt loses its saltiness,
			how can it be made salty again?
			It is no longer good for anything,

			"You are the light of the world.
			A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
			Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
			Instead they put it on its stand,
			and it gives light to everyone in the house.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"In the same way,
			let your light shine before men,
			that they may see your good deeds
			and praise your Father in heaven."
