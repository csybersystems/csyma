	<verses>
		<verse>
			Christ is made the sure foundation,
			Christ, our head and cornerstone,
			Chosen of the Lord and precious,
			Binding all the Church in one;
			Holy Zion's help forever
			And our confidence alone.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To this temple where we call You,
			Come, O Lord of hosts, and stay;
			Come, with all Your loving kindness,
			Hear Your people as they pray;
			And Your fullest benediction
			Shed within these walls today.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Grant, we pray to all Your faithful
			All the gifts they ask to gain;
			What they gain from You forever
			With the blessed to retain;
			And hereafter in Your glory
			Evermore with You to reign.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise and honor to the Father,
			Praise and honor to the Son,
			Praise and honor to the Spirit,
			Ever three and ever one:
			One in might and one in glory
			While unending ages run!
		</verse>
