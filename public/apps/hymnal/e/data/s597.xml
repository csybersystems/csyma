		<verse>
			Ye servants of the Lord,
			Each in his office wait;
			Observant of His heavenly word,
			And watchful at his gate.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let all your lamps be bright,
			And trim the golden flame;
			Gird up your loins as in His sight;
			His coming thus proclaim.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Watch, 'tis your Lord's command,
			And while we speak  he's near;
			Mark the first signal of His hand,
			And ready all appear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O happy servant, he,
			In such a posture found!
			He shall his Lord with rapture see,
			And be with honor crowned.
		</verse>
