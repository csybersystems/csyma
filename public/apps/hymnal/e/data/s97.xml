	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord of the boundless curves of space
			And time's deep mystery,
			To Your creative might we trace
			All nature's energy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Your mind conceived the galaxy,
			Each atom's secret planned,
			And every age of history
			Your purpose, Lord, has spanned.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yours is the image stamped on man,
			Though marred by man's own sin;
			And Yours the liberating plan
			Again his soul to win.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Give us to know Your truth; but more,
			The strength to do Your will;
			Until the love our souls adore
			Shall all our being fill.
		</verse>
