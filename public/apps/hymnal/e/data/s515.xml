		<refrain>
			The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;
			By day and by night He leads me along;
			The lord is my light, my joy and my song;
			By day and by night He leads me along.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?
			By day and by night His presence is near;
			He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;
			This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord is my light; though clouds may arise,
			Faith, stronger that sight, looks up to the skies
			Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:
			Then how can I ever in darkness remain?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord is my light, The Lord is my strength;
			I know in His might I'll conquer at length;
			My weakness in mercy He covers with power,
			And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord is my light, my all and  in all;
			There is in His sight no darkness at all;
			He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;
			With saints and with angels His praises I sing.
		</verse>
