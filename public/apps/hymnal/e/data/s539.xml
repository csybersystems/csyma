	<verses>
		<refrain>
			For He loves me, yes, He loves me,
			Jesus loves me, this I know.
			Jesus loves me, died to save me,
			This is why I love Him so.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I will early seek the Savior,
			I will learn of Him each day;
			I will follow in His footsteps,
			I will walk the narrow way.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will hasten where He bids me,
			I am not too young to go
			In the pathway where He leadeth,
			Not too young His will to know.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He is standing at the doorway
			Of escape from every sin;
			I will knock, for He has promised,
			He will hear and let me in.
		</verse>
