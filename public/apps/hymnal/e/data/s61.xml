		<verse>
			God is here! As we His people
			Meet to offer praise and prayer,
			May we find in fuller measure
			What it is in Christ we share.
			Here, as in the world around us,
			All our varied skills and arts
			Wait the coming of the Spirit
			Into open minds and hearts.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Here are symbols to remind us
			Of our life long need of grace;
			Here are table, font, and pulpit;
			Here the Word has central place.
			Here in honesty of preaching,
			Here in silence, as in speech,
			Here, in newness and renewal,
			God the Spirit comes to each.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Here our children find a welcome
			In the Shepherd's flock and fold,
			Here, as bread and wine are taken
			Christ sustains us as of old.
			Here the servants of the Servant
			Seek in worship to explore
			What it means in daily living
			To believe and to adore.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord of all, of church and kingdom,
			In age of change and doubt
			Keep us faithful to the gospel,
			Help us work Your purpose out.
			Here, in this day's dedication,
			All we have to give, receive,
			We, who cannot live without You,
			We adore You! we believe!
