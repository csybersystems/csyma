		<verse>
			Day by day and with each passing moment,
			Strength I find to meet my trials here;
			Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,
			I've no cause for worry or for fear,
			He whose heart is kind beyond all measure
			Gives unto each day what he deems best
			Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
			Mingling toil with peace and rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me
			With a special mercy for each hour;
			All my cares he fain would bear, and cheer me,
			He whose name is Counselor and Pow'r.
			The protection of His child and treasure
			Is a charge that on Himself He laid:
			As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,
			This the pledge to me he made.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Help me then in ev'ry tribulation
			So to trust Thy promises, O Lord:
			That I lose not faith's sweet consolation
			Offered me within Thy holy Word.
			Help me Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
			E'er to take, as from a father's hand,
			One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
			Till I reach the promised land.
		</verse>
