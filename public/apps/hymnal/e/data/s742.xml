	<eTitle>THE LORD WORKS JUSTICE -- Psalm 103, RSV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The Lord works vindication and justice
			for all who are oppressed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He made known his ways to Moses,
			his acts to the people of Israel.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As far as the east is from the west,
			so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As a father pities his children,
			so the Lord pities those who fear him.
			For he knows our frame;
			he remembers that we are dust.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As for man, his days are like grass;
			he flourishes like a flower of the field;
			for the wind passes over it,
			and it is gone,
			and its place knows it no more.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But the steadfast love of the Lord
			is from everlasting to everlasting
			upon those who fear him,
			and his righteousness to children's children,
			to those who keep his covenant
			and remember to do his commandments.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord has established his throne
			in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Bless the Lord, 0 you his angels,
			you mighty ones who do his word,
			hearkening to the voice of his word!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Bless the Lord, all his hosts,
			his ministers that do his will!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Bless the Lord, all his works,
			in all places of his dominion.
			Bless the Lord, 0 my soul!
		</verse>
