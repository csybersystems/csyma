	<verses>
		<verse>
			Nature with open volume stands,
			To spread its Maker's praise abroad;
			And every labor of His hands
			Shows something worthy of our God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But in the grace that rescued us
			His brightest form of glory shines;
			'Tis fairest drawn upon the cross
			In precious blood and crimson lines.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Here His whole name appears complete.
			Nor wit can guess, nor reason prove,
			Which of the letters best is writ,
			The pow'r, the wisdom, or the love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We would forever speak His name
			In sounds to mortal ears unknown,
			With angels join to praise the Lamb,
			And worship at His Father's throne.
		</verse>
