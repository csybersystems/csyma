	<eTitle>Because He Lives</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Because He lives I can face tomorrow,
			Because He lives all fear is gone;
			Because I know  He holds the future.
			And life is worth the living just because He lives.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,
			He came to love, heal, and forgive;
			He lived and died to buy my pardon,
			An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
			And feel the pride, and joy He gives;
			But greater still the calm assurance,
			This child can face uncertain days because He lives.
		</verse>
