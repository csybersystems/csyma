	<eTitle>I WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE LORD -- Psalm 40, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			I waited patiently for the Lord;
			he turned to me and heard my cry.
			He lifted me out of the slimy pit,
			out of the mud and mire;
			he set my feet on a rock and gave me
			a firm place to stand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He put a new song in my mouth,
			a hymn of praise to our God.
			Many will see and fear and put their
			trust in the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust,
			who does not look to the proud,
			to those who turn aside to false gods.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Many, 0 Lord my God,
			are the wonders you have done.
			The things you planned for us
			no one can recount to you;
			were I to speak and tell of them,
			they would be too many to declare.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"To do your will, 0 my God, is my desire;
			your law is within my heart."...
			I do not hide your righteousness in my heart;
			I speak of your faithfulness and salvation.
			I do not conceal your love and your truth
			from the great assembly.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Do not withhold your mercy from me, 0 Lord;
			may your love and your truth always protect me.
		</verse>
