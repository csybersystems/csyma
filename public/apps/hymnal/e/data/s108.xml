		<verse>
			Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
			that saved a wretch like me!
			I once was lost, but now am found;
			was blind, but now I see.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
			and grace my fears relieved;
			how precious did that grace appear
			the hour I first believed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord has promised good to me,
			his word my hope secures;
			he will my shield and portion be,
			as long as life endures.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
			I have already come;
			'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
			and grace will lead me home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When we've been there ten thousand years,
			bright shining as the sun,
			we've no less days to sing God's praise
			than when we first begun.
		</verse>
