	<verses>
		<verse>
			Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
			The blood of Jesus whispers peace within
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
			To do the will of Jesus; this is rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
			In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
			Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
		</verse>
