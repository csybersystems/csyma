		<verse>
			My Maker and my King,
			To Thee my all I owe;
			Thy sovereign bounty is the spring
			Whence all my blessings flow;
			Thy sovereign bounty is the spring
			Whence all my blessings flow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The creature of Thy hand,
			On Thee alone I live;
			My God, Thy benefits demand
			More praise than I can give.
			My God, Thy benefits demand
			More praise than I can give.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, what can I impart
			When all is Thine before?
			Thy love demands a thankful heart;
			The gift, alas! how poor.
			Thy love demands a thankful heart;
			The gift, alas! how poor.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O! let Thy grace inspire
			My soul with strength divine;
			Let every word and each desire
			And all my days be Thine.
			Let every word and each desire
			And all my days be Thine.
