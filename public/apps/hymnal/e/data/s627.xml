		<verse>
			We are climbing Jacob's ladder.
			We are climbing Jacob's ladder.
			We are climbing Jacob's ladder,
			Soldiers of the cross.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Every round goes higher, higher.
			Every round goes higher, higher.
			Every round goes higher, higher,
			Soldiers of the cross.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sinner, do you love my Jesus?
			Sinner, do you love my Jesus?
			Sinner, do you love my Jesus?
			Soldiers of the cross.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If you love Him, why not serve Him?
			If you love Him, why not serve Him?
			If you love Him, why not serve Him?
			Soldiers of the cross.
