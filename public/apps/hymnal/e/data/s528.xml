	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Mighty Rock in a weary land,                 
			Mighty Rock
			Cooling shade on the burning sand,                 
			Cooling shade
			Faithful guide for the pilgrim band-                 
			Faithful guide
			A shelter in the time of storm.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide,
			A shelter in the time of storm;
			Secure whatever may be tide,
			A shelter in the time of storm.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A shade by day, defense by night,
			A shelter in the time of storm;
			No fears alarm, no foes affright,
			A shelter in the time of storm.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The raging floods may round us beat,
			A shelter in the time of storm;
			We find in God a safe retreat,
			A shelter in the time of storm.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
			A shelter in the time of storm;
			Be Thou our helper, ever near,
			A shelter in the time of storm.
		</verse>
