	<verses>
		<verse>
			When I can read my title clear
			To mansions in the skies
			I'll bid farewell to every fear,
			And wipe my weeping eyes;
			And wipe my weeping eyes,
			And wipe my weeping eyes,
			I'll bid farewell to every fear,
			And wipe my weeping eyes.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Should earth against my soul engage,
			And fiery darts be hurled,
			Then I can smile at Satan's rage,
			And face a frowning world;
			And face a frowning world,
			And face a frowning world,
			Then I can smile at Satan's rage,
			And face a frowning world.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let cares like a wild deluge come,
			And storms or sorrow fall!
			May I but safely reach my home,
			May God, my heav'n, my all;
			My God. my heav'n, my all,
			My God, my heav'n, my all,
			May I but safely reach my home,
			My God, my heav'n, my all.
		</verse>
