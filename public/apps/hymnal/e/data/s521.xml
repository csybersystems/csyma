		<verse>
			Depth of mercy! Can there be
			mercy still reserved for me?
			Can my God his wrath forbear,
			me, the chief of sinners, spare?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I have long withstood his grace,
			long provoked him to his face,
			would not hearken to his calls,
			grieved him by a thousand falls.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now incline me to repent,
			let me now my sins lament,
			now my foul revolt deplore,
			weep, believe, and sin no more.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There for me the Savior stands,
			shows his wounds and spreads His hands.
			God is love! I know, I feel;
			Jesus weeps and loves me still.
		</verse>
