	<verses>
		<verse>
			O God, unseen, yet ever near,
			Reveal Thy presence now
			While we in love that hath no fear,
			Before Thy glory bow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Here may Thy faithful people know
			The blessings of Thy love,
			The streams that thro'  the dessert  flow,
			The manna from above.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We come, obedient to Thy Word
			To  feast on heav'nly food,
			Our meat, the body of our Lord,
			Our drink, His precious blood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thus may we all Thy words obey,
			For we, O God, are Thine,
			And go rejoicing on our way,
			Renewed by strength divine.
		</verse>
