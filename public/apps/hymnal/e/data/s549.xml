	<verses>
		<verse>
			Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep,
			Keep Thy lamb, in safety keep;
			Nothing can Thy power withstand,
			None can pluck me from Thy Hand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Loving Shepherd, ever near,
			Teach Thy Lamb Thy voice to hear,
			Suffer not my steps to stray
			From the straight and narrow way.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Where Thou leadest I would go,
			Walking in Thy steps below,
			Till within the heavenly fold,
			I my shepherd shall behold.
		</verse>
