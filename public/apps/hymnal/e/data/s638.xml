	<eTitle>The Wise May Bring Their Learning</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The wise may bring their learning,
			The rich may bring their wealth,
			And some may bring their greatness,
			And some their strength and health:
			We too would bring our treasures
			To offer to the King,
			We have no wealth or learning---
			What shall we children bring?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We'll bring Him hearts that love Him,
			We'll bring Him thankful praise,
			And young souls meekly striving
			To follow in His ways:
			And these shall be the treasures
			We offer to the King,
			And these are gifts that ever
			The poorest child may bring.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We'll bring the little duties
			We have to do each day;
			We'll try our best to please Him
			At home, at school, at play:
			And better are these treasures
			To offer to the King
			Than richest gift without them:
			Yet these a child may bring.
		</verse>
