	<verses>
		<verse>
			Work, for the night is coming;
			Work through the morning hours;
			Work while the dew is sparkling;
			Work 'mid springing flowers;
			Work while the day grows brighter,
			Under the glowing sun;
			Work, for the night is coming,
			When man's work is done.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Work, for the night is coming;
			Work through the sunny noon;
			Fill brightest hours with labor,
			Rest comes sure and soon;
			Give every flying minute
			Something to keep in store;
			Work, for the night is coming,
			When man works no more.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Work, for the night is coming:
			Under the sunset skies,
			While their bright tints are glowing,
			Work for the daylight flies;
			Work till the last beam fadeth,
			Fadeth to shine no more;
			Work, for the Lord is coming,
			When man's work is o'er.
		</verse>
