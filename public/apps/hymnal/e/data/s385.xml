	<verses>
		<verse>
			Crowning jewel of creation,
			Blest and hallowed, sanctified;
			Time and changes all transcending,
			Shared forever, glorified.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Blessed Sabbath made for man,
			Gift from the Creator's hand.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Sin and sickness, prayer and weeping
			Cease at close of earthly days;
			But Thy Sabbath is eternal,
			Joyful thanks to Thee we raise!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Teach us Lord, in storm or sunshine
			How to truly rest in Thee,
			May Thy Sabbath peace enfold us
			And our shelter ever be.
		</verse>
