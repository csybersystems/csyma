	<verses>
		<verse>
			I will exalt you, my God the King;
			I will praise your name for ever and ever.
			Every day I will praise you
			and extol your name for ever and ever.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise;
			his greatness no one can fathom.
			One generation will commend your
			works to another;
			they will tell of your mighty acts.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			They will celebrate your abundant goodness
			and joyfully sing of your righteousness.
			The Lord is gracious and compassionate,
			slow to anger and rich in love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord is faithful to all his promises
			and loving toward all he has made.
			The Lord upholds all those who fall
			and lifts up all who are bowed down.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The eyes of all look to you,
			and you give them their food at the proper time.
			You open your hand and satisfy the desires
			of every living thing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord is righteous in all His ways
			and loving toward all he has made.
			The Lord is near to all who call on him,
			to all who call on him in truth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He fulfills the desires of those who fear him;
			he hears their cry and saves them.
			The Lord watches over all who love him,
			but all the wicked he will destroy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord.
			Let every creature praise his holy
			name for ever and ever.
		</verse>
