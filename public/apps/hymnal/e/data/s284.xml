	<verses>
		<verse>
			I have a Savior, He's pleading in glory,
			A dear, loving Savior, though earth friends be few;
			And now He is watching in tenderness o√©r me,
			But oh that my Savior were your Savior, too.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			For you I am praying, For you I am praying,
			For you I am praying, I'm praying for you.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I have a Father; to me He has given
			A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
			And soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven,
			But oh that He'd let me bring you with me, too!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I have a robe; 'tis resplendent in whiteness,
			Awaiting in glory my wondering view;
			Oh, when I receive it, all shining in brightness,
			Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,
			That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;
			Then pray that you Savior will bring them to glory,
			And prayer will be answered-'twas answered for you!
		</verse>
