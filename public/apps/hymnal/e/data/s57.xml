		<verse>
			Now all the woods are sleeping,
			And night and stillness creeping
			O'er city, man, and beast;
			But thou, my heart, awake thee,
			To pray'r awhile be take thee,
			And praise thy Maker ere thou rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My Jesus, stay Thou by me,
			And let no foe come nigh me,
			Safe sheltered by Thy wing;
			But would the foe alarm me,
			O let him never harm me,
			But still Thine angels round me sing!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My loved ones, rest securely,
			From every peril surely
			Our God will guard your heads;
			And happy slumbers send you,
			And bid His hosts attend you,
			And golden armed watch o'er your beds.
		</verse>
