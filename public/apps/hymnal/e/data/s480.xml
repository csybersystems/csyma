	<verses>
		<verse>
			Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
			forgive our foolish ways;
			reclothe us in our rightful mind,
			in purer lives thy service find,
			in deeper reverence, praise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In simple trust like theirs who heard,
			beside the Syrian sea,
			the gracious calling of the Lord,
			let us, like them, without a word,
			rise up and follow thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O sabbath rest by Galilee,
			O calm of hills above,
			where Jesus knelt to share with thee
			the silence of eternity,
			interpreted by love!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Drop thy still dews of quietness,
			till all our strivings cease;
			take from our souls the strain and stress,
			and let our ordered lives confess
			the beauty of thy peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Breathe through the heats of our desire
			thy coolness and thy balm;
			let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
			speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,
			O still, small voice of calm.
		</verse>
