	<verses>
		<verse>
			Praise the Lord.
			I will extol the Lord with all my heart
			in the council of the upright and in the assembly.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Great are the works of the Lord;
			they are pondered by all who delight in them.
			Glorious and majestic are his deeds,
			and his righteousness endures forever.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He has caused his wonders to be remembered;
			the Lord is gracious and compassionate.
			He provides food for those who fear him;
			he remembers his covenant forever.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He has shown his people the power of his works,
			giving them the lands of other nations.
			The works of his hands are faithful and just;
			all his precepts are trustworthy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			They are steadfast for ever and ever,
			done in faithfulness and uprightness.
			He provided redemption for his people;
			he ordained his covenant forever
			holy and awesome is his name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The fear of the Lord
			is the beginning of wisdom;
			all who follow his precepts
			have good understanding.
			To him belongs eternal praise.
