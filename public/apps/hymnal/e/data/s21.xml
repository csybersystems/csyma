		<verse>
			Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
			In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
			Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
			Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
			Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;
			Thy justice, like mountains, high soaring above
			Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small;
			In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
			We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
			Then wither and perish - but naught changeth Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,
			Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;
			All laud we would render; O help us to see
			'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee!
		</verse>
