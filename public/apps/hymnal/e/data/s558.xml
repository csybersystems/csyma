		<verse>
			For the fruits of His creation, thanks be to God;
			For the gifts to every nation, thanks be to god;
			For the plowing, sowing, reaping,
			Silent growth while men are sleeping,
			Future needs in earth's safe keeping, thanks be to God!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the just reward of labor, God's will is done;
			In the help we give our neighbor, God's will is done;
			In our worldwide task of caring
			For the hungry and despairing,
			In the harvests men are sharing, God's will is done.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the harvests of His Spirit, thanks be to God;
			For the good all men inherit, thanks be to God;
			For the wonders that astounds us,
			For the truths that still confound us,
			Most of all, that love has found us, thanks be to God!
