	<verses>
		<verse>
			Seek ye first the kingdom, 'Tis your Father's will.
			So the voice of Jesus bids us follow still.
			Savior, we would hear Thee, Follow, find, and see;
			And in life's adventure Thy disciples be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As for hidden treasure, Or for matchless pearl,
			When at last discovered, some will sell their all:
			So, when breaks the vision of that kingdom fair,
			Ours shall be its riches and its beauty rare.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As the silent leaven works its secret way,
			Or as grows the seed grain through the night and day;
			Lord, so be the increase, peaceable but sure,
			Of Thy word within us, And Thy kingdom's power.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As the tender seedling grows up tall and strong,
			And the birds of heaven to its branches throng;
			So shall all God's children, from the east and west,
			Gather to His kingdom, In its shadow rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Humblest shall be greatest, poor in spirit reign;
			Home shall come the childlike, born through Thee again
			Eager hearts arrive there on the pilgrim's road,
			Hail! the kingdom glorious of the living God!
		</verse>
