	<verses>
		<verse>
			When I survey the wondrous cross
			on which the Prince of Glory died;
			my richest gain I count but loss,
			and pour contempt on all my pride.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
			save in the death of Christ, my God;
			all the vain things that charm me most,
			I sacrifice them to his blood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
			sorrow and love flow mingled down.
			Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
			or thorns compose so rich a crown.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Were the whole realm of nature mine,
			that were a present far too small;
			love so amazing, so divine,
			demands my soul, my life, my all.
		</verse>
