		<verse>
			Awake, awake to love and work!
			The lark is in the sky;
			The fields are wet with diamond dew;
			The worlds awake to cry
			Their blessings on the Lord of life,
			As He goes meekly by.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,
			Shout with their shout of praise;
			See how the giant sun soars up,
			Great lord of years and days!
			So let the love of Jesus come
			And set thy soul ablaze.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To give and give, and give again, 
			What God hath given thee;
			To spend thyself nor count the cost;
			To serve right gloriously
			The God who gave all worlds that are,
			And all that are to be.
		</verse>
