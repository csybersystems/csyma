	<eTitle>GENEROSITY -- 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			See that you .... excel
			in this grace of giving....
			For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
			that though he was rich,
			yet for your sakes he became poor,
			so that you through his poverty
			might become rich.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If the willingness is there,
			the gift is acceptable according to what one has,
			not according to what he does not have.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Remember this:
			Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,
			and whoever sows generously
			will also reap generously.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Each man should give what he has
			decided in his heart to give,	
			not reluctantly or under compulsion,
			for God loves a cheerful giver.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And God is able to make all grace abound to you,
			so that in all things at all times,
			having all that you need,
			you will abound in every good work.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now he who supplies seed to the sower
			and bread for food will also supply
			and increase your store of seed
			and will enlarge the harvest
			of your righteousness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You will made rich in every way
			so that you can be generous on every occasion,
			and through us your generosity will
			result in thanksgiving to God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This service that you perform is not
			only supplying the needs of God's people
			but is also overflowing in many
			expressions of thanks to God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Because of the service by which
			you have proved yourselves,
			men will praise God for the obedience
			that accompanies your confession of
			the gospel of Christ,
			and for your generosity in sharing with them
			and with everyone else.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And in their prayers for you their
			hearts will go out to you,
			because of the surpassing grace
			God has given you.
			Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
