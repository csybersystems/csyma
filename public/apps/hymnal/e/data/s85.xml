		<verse>
			Eternal Father, strong to save,
			Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,
			Who bid'st the mighty ocean deep
			Its own appointed limits keep;
			Oh hear us when we cry to Thee
			For those in peril on the sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Christ, whose voice the waters heard,
			And hushed their raging at Thy word,
			Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
			And calm amidst its rage didst sleep;
			Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
			For those in peril on the sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Holy Spirit, who didst brood
			Upon the waters dark and rude,
			And bid their angry tumult cease,
			And give, for wild confusion, peace:
			Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
			For those in peril on the sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Trinity of love and power,
			All trav'lers shield in danger's hour;
			From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
			Protect them wheresoe'er they go;
			Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
			Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.
		</verse>
