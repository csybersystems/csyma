	<eTitle>REIGNING FOREVER WITH GOD -- Revelation 21 and 22, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			"I am the Alpha and the Omega,
			The beginning and the end.
			I will give of the fountain of the water
			of life freely to him who thirsts.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"He who overcomes  shall inherited all thins,
			and I will be his God and he shall be My son."
			
			And he showed me a pure river  of water of life,
			clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne
			of God and of the Lamb.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the middle of its street,
			and on either side of the river,
			was the tree of life,
			which bore twelve fruits every month.
			And the leaves of the tree were for
			the healing of the nations.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And there shall be no more curse,
			but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it,
			and His servants shall serve Him.
			They shall see His face,
			and His name shall be on their foreheads.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And there shall be no night there,
			they need no lamp for light of the sun,
			for the Lord god gives them light,
			And they shall reign forever and ever.
		</verse>
