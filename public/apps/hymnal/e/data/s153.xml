	<verses>
		<verse>
			Prince of Peace, control my will,
			Bid this struggling heart be still;
			Bid my fears and doubtings cease,
			Hush my spirit into peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,
			Opened wide the gate to God;
			Peace, I ask, but peace must be,
			Lord, in being one with Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May Thy will, not mine, be done,
			May Thy will and mine be one;
			Chase these doubtings from my heart,
			Now Thy perfect peace impart.
		</verse>
