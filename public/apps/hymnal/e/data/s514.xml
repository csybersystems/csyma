		<verse>
			Lord of our life, and God of our salvation,
			Star of our night, and hope of every nation,
			Hear and receive Thy church's supplication,
			Lord God Almighty.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth;
			Lord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth;
			Lord, o'er Thy rock nor death nor hell prevaileth;
			Grant us Thy peace, Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Peace in our hearts our evil thoughts assuaging;
			Peace in Thy church, where brothers are engaging;
			Peace, when the world its busy war is waging;
			Send us, O Savior.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Grant us Thy help till foes are backward driven;
			Grant them Thy truth that thy may be forgiven;
			Grant peace on earth, and after we have striven,
			Peace in Thy heaven.
		</verse>
