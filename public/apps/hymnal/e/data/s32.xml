	<eTitle>When in Our Music God Is Glorified</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			When in our music God is glorified,
			And adoration leaves no room for pride,
			It is as though the whole creation cried:
			Alleluia! Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How oft, in making music, we have found
			A new dimension in the world of sound,
			As worship moved us to a more profound
			Alleluia! Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And did not Jesus sing a psalm that night
			When utmost evil strove against the light?
			Then let us sing for whom He won the fight:
			Alleluia! Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let every instrument be used for praise;
			Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise;
			And may God give us faith to sing always:
			Alleluia! Alleluia!
		</verse>
