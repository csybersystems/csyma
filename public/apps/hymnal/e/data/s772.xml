	<eTitle>MEMORIAL OF HUMILITY -- John 13, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus knew that the time had come for him
			to leave this world and go to the Father.
			Having loved his own who were in the world,
			he now showed them the full extent of his love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He got up from the meal,
			took off his outer clothing,
			and wrapped a towel around his waist.
			After that, he poured water into a basin
			and began to wash his disciples' feet,
			drying them with the towel
			that was wrapped around him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He came to Simon Peter, who said to him,
			"Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
			Jesus replied, "You do not realize
			now what I am doing,
			but later you will understand."
			"No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you,
			you have no part with me."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied,
			"not just my feet but my hands and
			my head as well!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus answered,
			"A person who has had a bath
			needs only to wash his feet;
			his whole body is clean."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When he had finished washing their feet,
			he put on his clothes and returned to his place.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Do you understand what I have
			done for your" tie asked them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,'
			and rightly so, for that is what I am.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Now that I, your Lord and Teacher,
			have washed your feet, 
			you also should wash one
			another's feet.
			I have set you an example that you
			should do as I have done for you."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Now that you know these things,
			you will be blessed if you do them."
