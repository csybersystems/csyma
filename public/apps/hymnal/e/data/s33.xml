		<verse>
			Sing a new song to the Lord,
			He to whom wonders belong.
			Rejoice in His triumph and tell of His power.
			O sing a new song to the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now to the ends of the earth
			See His salvation is shown.
			And still He remembers His mercy and truth,
			Unchanging in love to His own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sing a new song and rejoice.
			Publish His praises abroad.
			Let voices in chorus with trumpet and horn,
			Resound for the joy of the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Join with the hills and the sea,
			Thunders of praise to prolong.
			In judgment and justice
			He comes to the earth.
			O sing a new song to the Lord.
