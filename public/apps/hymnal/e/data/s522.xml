	<verses>
		<refrain>
			On Christ the solid rock I stand;
			All other ground is sinking sand,
			All other ground is sinking sand.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			My hope is built on nothing less
			Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
			I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
			But wholly leand on Jesus' name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When Darkness seems to veils His face,
			I rest on His unchanging grace.
			In every high and stormy gale,
			My anchor holds within the veil.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His oath, his covenant, his blood
			Support me in the whelming flood.
			When all around my soul gives way,
			He then is all my hope and stay.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When He shall come with trumpet sound,
			O may I then in Him be found!
			Clad in His righteousness alone,
			Faultless to stand before the throne.
		</verse>
