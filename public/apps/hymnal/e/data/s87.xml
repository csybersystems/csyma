	<verses>
		<verse>
			God who spoke in the beginning,
			Forming rock and shaping spar,
			Set all life and growth in motion,
			Earthly world and distant star;
			He who calls the earth to order
			Is the ground of what we are.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God who spoke thro' men and nations,
			Thro' events long past and gone,
			Showing still today His purpose,
			Speaks supremely through His Son;
			He who calls the earth to order
			Gives His word and it is done.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God whose speech becomes incarnate-
			Christ is servant, Christ is Lord-
			Calls us to a life of service,
			Heart and will to action stirred;
			He who uses man's obedience
			Has the first and final word.
		</verse>
