		<verse>
			With songs and honors sounding loud,
			Address the Lord on high;
			Over the heavens He spreads His cloud,
			And waters veil the sky.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He sends His showers of blessing down
			To cheer the plains below;
			He makes the grass the mountains crown,
			And corning valleys grow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His steady counsels change the face
			Of the declining year;
			He bids the sun cut short his race,
			And wintry days appear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He sends His word, and melts the snow;
			The fields no longer mourn;
			He calls the warmer gales to blow,
			And bids the spring return.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The changing wind, the flying cloud,
			Obey His mighty word:
			With songs and honors sounding loud
			Praise ye the sovereign Lord!
		</verse>
