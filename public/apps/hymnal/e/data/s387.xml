	<verses>
		<verse>
			Peace and healing on thy wing;
			And to every troubled breast
			Speak of the divine behest:
			Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Earthly longings bid retire,
			Quench the passions' hurtful fire;
			To the wayward, sin oppressed,
			Bring thou thy divine behest:
			Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Wipe from every cheek the tear,
			Banish care and silence fear;
			All things working for the best,
			Teach us the divine behest:
			Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!
		</verse>
