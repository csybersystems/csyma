	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Faith is the victory! Faith is the victory!
			O, glorious victory, That overcomes the world.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Encamped along the hills of light,
			Ye Christians soldiers, rise,
			And press the battle ere the night
			Shall veil the glowing skies.
			Against the foe in vales below
			Let all our strength be hurled;
			Faith is the victory, we know,
			That overcomes the world.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			On every hand the foe we find
			Drawn up in dread array;
			Let tents of ease be left behind,
			And onward to the fray;
			Salvation's helmet on  each head,
			With truth all girt about,
			The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,
			And echo with our shout.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To him that overcomes the foe,
			White raiment shall be giv'n;
			Before the angels he shall know
			His name confessed in heav'n.
			Then onward from the hills of light,
			Our hearts with love aflame,
			We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,
			In Jesus' conquering name.
		</verse>
