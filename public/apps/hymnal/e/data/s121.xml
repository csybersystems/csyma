	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Go, tell it on the mountain,
			Over the hills and everywhere:
			Go, tell it on the mountain
			That Jesus Christ is born!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			While shepherds kept their watching
			O'er silent flocks by night,
			Behold throughout the heavens
			There shone a holy light.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The shepherds feared and trembled
			When lo! Above the earth
			Rang out the angel chorus
			That hailed our Savior's birth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Down in a lowly manger
			The humble Christ was born,
			And brought us God's salvation
			That blessed Christmas morn.
		</verse>
