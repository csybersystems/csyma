	<verses>
		<verse>
			Angels we have heard on high,
			Singing sweetly through the night,
			And the mountains in reply
			Echoing their brave delight.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Gloria in excelsis Deo,
			Gloria in excelsis Deo.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Shepherds, why this jubilee?
			Why these songs of happy cheer?
			What great brightness did you see?
			What glad tidings did you hear?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come to Bethlehem and see
			Him whose birth the angels sing;
			Come, adore on bended knee
			Christ, the Lord, the newborn King.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			See Him in a manger laid
			Whom the angels praise above;
			Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
			While we raise our hearts in love.
		</verse>
