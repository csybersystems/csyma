	<verses>
		<verse>
			There is a balm in Gilead
			To make the wounded whole;
			There is a balm in Gilead
			To heal the sin-sick soul.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sometimes I feel discouraged,
			And think my work's in vain,
			But then the Holy Spirit
			Revives my soul again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If you can not preach like Peter,
			If you can not pray like Paul,
			You can tell the love of Jesus,
			And say He died for all.
		</verse>
