	<verses>
		<verse>
			You that know the Lord is gracious,
			You for whom cornerstone
			Stands, of God, elect and precious,
			Laid that you may build thereon,
			See that on that sure foundation
			You a living temple raise.
			Towers that may tell forth salvation
			Walls  that may reecho praise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Living stones  by God appointed
			Each to his lotted place,
			Kings and priests, by God anointed,
			Shall you not declare His grace?
			You a royal generation
			Tell the tidings of your birth,
			Tidings of a new creation
			To an old and weary earth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Tell the praise of Him who called you
			Out of darkness into light,
			Broke the fetters that enthralled you,
			Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:
			Tell the tale of sins forgiven
			Strength renewed and hope restored.
			Till the earth, in tune with heaven,
			Praise and magnify the Lord.
		</verse>
