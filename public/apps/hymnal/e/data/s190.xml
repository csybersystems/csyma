	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus loves me! this I know,
			For the Bible tells me so;
			Little ones to Him belong,
			They are weak, but He is strong.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me!
			Yes, Jesus loves me! The Bibles tells me so.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Jesus loves me! He who died
			Heaven's gate to open wide:
			He will wash away my sin,
			Let His little child come in.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus, take this heart of mine,
			Make it pure and wholly Thine;
			On the cross You died for me,
			I will love and live for Thee.
		</verse>
