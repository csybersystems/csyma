	<verses>
		<verse>
			I've wandered far away from God,
			Now I'm coming home;
			The paths of sin too long I've trod;
			Lord, I'm coming home.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Coming home, coming home
			Nevermore to roam;
			Open wide Thine arms of love;
			Lord, I'm coming home.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I've wasted many precious years,
			Now I'm coming home;
			I now repent with bitter tears;
			Lord, I'm coming home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord,
			Now I'm coming home;
			I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy word;
			Lord, I'm coming home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My only hope, my only plea,
			Now I'm coming home;
			That Jesus died, and died for me;
			Lord, I'm coming home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I need His cleansing blood I know,
			Now I'm coming home;
			O wash me whiter than snow;
			Lord, I'm coming home.
		</verse>
