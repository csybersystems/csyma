	<verses>
		<verse>
			"My soul magnifies the Lord,
			And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"For He has regarded the lowly
			state of His maidservant;
			For behold, henceforth all generations
			will call me blessed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"For He who is mighty has done
			great things for me,
			And holy is His name.
			And His mercy is on those who fear Him
			From generation to generations.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"He has shown strength with His arm;
			He has scattered the proud in the
			imagination of their hearts.
			He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
			And exalted the lowly.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"He has filled the hungry with good things,
			And the rich He has sent away empty.
			He has helped His servant Israel,
			In remembrance of His mercy,
			As He spoke to our fathers,
			To Abraham and to his seed forever."
		</verse>
