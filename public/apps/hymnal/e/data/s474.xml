		<refrain>
			Precious name (Precious name,)
			O how sweet! (O how sweet!)
			Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
			Precious name (Precious name,)
			O how sweet! (O how sweet, how sweet!)
			Hope of earth and joy of heaven.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Take the name of Jesus with you,
			Child of sorrow and of woe;
			It will joy and comfort give you,
			Take it, where'er you go.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Take the name of Jesus ever,
			As a shield from every snare;
			If temptations  round you gather,
			Breathe that holy name in prayer.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O the precious name of Jesus!
			How it thrills our souls with joy,
			When His loving arms receive us,
			And His songs our tongues employ!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			At the name of Jesus bowing,
			Falling prostrate at His feet,
			King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him,
			When our journey is complete.
		</verse>
