	<verses>
		<verse>
			When the church of Jesus shuts its outer door,
			Lest the roar of traffic drown the voice of prayer:
			May our prayers, Lord, make us ten times more aware
			That the world banish is our Christian care.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If our hearts are lifted where devotion soars
			High above this hungry suffering world of ours;
			Lest our hymns should drug us to forget its needs,
			Forge our Christian worship into Christian deeds.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lest the gifts we offer, Money, talents, time,
			Serve to salve our conscience to our secret shame;
			Lord, reprove, inspire us by the way you give;
			Teach us, dying Savior, how true Christians live.
		</verse>
