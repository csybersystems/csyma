		<verse>
			When Jesus comes in glory,
			As Lord and King of kings,
			O what a wondrous story
			The blessed Bible brings:
			His face will shine like sunlight,
			His head be white as snow,
			His eyes like flaming firelight,
			His feet like brass aglow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His voice like rushing waters
			Will reach with mighty sound
			Into the deepest quarters
			Of all creation round;
			And at this wondrous greeting
			The dead in Christ shall rise,
			Their Lord and Savior meeting
			In glory in the skies.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And we who are believing
			And His appearing love,
			Shall know we are receiving
			His glory from above;
			His resurrection power
			Will raise us to the place
			Where we that wondrous hour
			Shall see Him face to face.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O hasten Thine appearing,
			Thou bright and Morning Star!
			Lord, may we soon be hearing
			The trumpet sound afar;
			Thy people all are yearning
			To be Thy raptured bride,
			And at Thine own returning
			Be caught up to Thy side.
		</verse>
