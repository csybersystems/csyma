		<refrain>
			To gather His loved ones home,
			To gather His loved ones home.
			There'll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,
			To gather His loved ones home.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,
			There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,
			There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,
			To gather His loved ones home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,
			There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,
			But a glorius morrow when Jesus comes,
			To gather His loved ones home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
			There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
			There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
			To gather His loved ones home.
