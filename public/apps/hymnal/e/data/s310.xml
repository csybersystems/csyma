	<verses>
		<verse>
			I would draw nearer to Jesus,
					In His sweet presence abide,
					Constantly trying to serve Him,
					Safe and secure at His side.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			I would draw nearer to Jesus,
					I would draw nearer to Him;
					Fully surrendered each moment,
					I would draw nearer to Him.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I would draw nearer to Jesus,
					Nothing witholding from Him,
					Knowing He loves to be gracious,
					I would draw nearer to Him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I would draw nearer to Jesus,
					Seeking His strength to be true,
					Willing to tell of His goodness,
					Gladly His blest will to do.
		</verse>
