	<verses>
		<verse>
			What child is this, who, laid to rest,
			On Mary's lap is sleeping?
			Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
			While shepherds watch are keeping?
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			This, this is Christ the King,
			Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
			Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
			The babe, the son of Mary.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Why lies He in such mean estate
			Where ox and ass are feeding?
			Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
			The silent Word is pleading.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
			Come, peasant, king, to own Him,
			The King of kings salvation brings,
			Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
		</verse>
