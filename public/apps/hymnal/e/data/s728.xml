	<eTitle>LET THE REDEEMED THANK THE LORD -- Psalm 107, RSV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Let [the redeemed] thank the Lord
			for his steadfast love,
			for his wonderful works to the sons	of men!...
			And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,
			and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Some went down to the sea in ships,
			doing business on the great waters;
			they saw the deeds of the Lord,
			his wondrous works in the deep.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For he commanded, and raised the stormy wind,
			which lifted up the waves of the sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			They mounted up to heaven,
			they went down to the depths;
			their courage melted away in their evil plight;
			they reeled and staggered like drunken men,
			and were at their wits' end.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
			and he delivered them from their distress;
			he made the storm be still,
			and the waves of the sea were hushed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then they were glad because they had quiet,
			and he brought them to their desired haven.
			Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
			for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let them extol him in the congregation 
			of the people,
			and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
			
			He turns rivers into a desert,
			springs of water into thirsty ground,
			a fruitful land into a salty waste,
			because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He turns a desert into pools of water,
			a parched land into springs of water.
			And there he lets the hungry dwell,
			and they establish a city to live in;
			they sow fields, and plant vineyards, 
			and get a fruitful yield.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Whoever is wise, let him give heed
			to these things;
			let men consider the steadfast love
			of the Lord.
		</verse>
