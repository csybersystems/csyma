	<eTitle>THINGS SEEN AND UNSEEN -- 2 Corinthians 4, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			We do not lose heart.
			Even though our outward man is perishing,
			yet the inward man is being renewed
			day by day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For our light affliction,
			which is but for a moment,
			is working for us a far more exceeding
			and eternal weight of glory,
			while we do not look at the things
			which are seen,
			but at the things which are not seen.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the things which are seen are temporary,
			but the things which are not seen are eternal.
		</verse>
