		<verse>
			Go to dark Gethsemane,
			ye that feel the tempter's power;
			your Redeemer's conflict see,
			watch with him one bitter hour.
			Turn not from his griefs away;
			learn of Jesus Christ to pray.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			See him at the judgment hall,
			beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;
			See Him meekly bearing all
			Love to man His soul sustained;
			Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
			learn of Christ to bear the cross.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
			there, adoring at his feet,
			mark that miracle of time,
			God's own sacrifice complete.
			It is finished! hear him cry;
			learn of Jesus Christ to die.
		</verse>
