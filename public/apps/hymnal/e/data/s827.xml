	<eTitle>THE CHRISTIAN HOME -- Ephesians 4 and 5, Jerusalem</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Never have grudges against others,
			or lose your temper,
			or raise your voice to anybody,
			or call each other names,
			or allow any sort of spitefulness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be friends with one another, and kind,
			forgiving each other as readily as
			God forgave you in Christ.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Try, then, to imitate God,
			as children of his that he loves,
			and follow Christ by loving as he loved you,
			giving himself up in our place
			as a fragrant offering and a sacrifice to God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Among you there must be
			not	even a mention of fornication
			or impurity in any of its forms,
			or promiscuity:
			this would hardly become the saints!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There must be no coarseness,
			or salacious talk and jokesâ€”
			all this is wrong for you;
			raise your voices in thanksgiving instead.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You were darkness once,
			but now you are light in the Lord;
			be like children of light.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sing the words and tunes of the psalms
			and hymns when you are together,
			and go on singing and chanting
			to the Lord in your hearts,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			so that always and everywhere
			you are giving thanks to God who is our Father
			in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
		</verse>
