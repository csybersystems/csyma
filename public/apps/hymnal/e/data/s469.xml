	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Leaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarms;
			leaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
			leaning on the everlasting arms;
			what a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
			leaning on the everlasting arms.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
			leaning on the everlasting arms;
			O how bright the path grows from day to day,
			leaning on the everlasting arms.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
			leaning on the everlasting arms?
			I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
			leaning on the everlasting arms.
		</verse>
