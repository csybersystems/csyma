	<verses>
		<verse>
			Once our blessed Christ of beauty
			Was veiled off from human views;
			But through suffering, death, and sorrow
			He has rent the veil in two.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			O behold the Man of Sorrows!
			O behold Him in plain view!
			Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
			Since He rent the veil in two;
			Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
			Since He rent the veil in two.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Yes, He is with God, the Father,
			Interceding there for you;
			For He is the Well beloved
			Since He rent the veil in two.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy angels bow before Him,
			Men of earth give praises due;
			For He is the mighty Conqueror
			Since He rent the veil in two.
		</verse>
