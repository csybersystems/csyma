	<verses>
		<verse>
			O Jesus Christ, to You may hymns be rising
			In every city for Your love and care;
			Inspire our worship, grant the glad surprising
			That Your blest Spirit brings men everywhere.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Grant us new courage, Vsacrificial, humble,
			Strong in Your strength to venture and to dare,
			To lift the fallen, guide the feet that stumbe,
			Seek out the lonely and God's mercy share.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Show us Your Spirit, brooding o'er each city,
			As You did weep above Jerusalem,
			Seeking to gather all in love and pity,
			And healing those who touch Your garment's hem.
		</verse>
