		<verse>
			In Heavenly love abiding,
			No change my heart shall fear,
			And safe is such confiding,
			For nothing changes here.
			The storm may roar without me,
			My heart may low be laid;
			But God is round about me,
			And can I be dismayed?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Wherever he may guide me,
			No want shall turn me back;
			My Shepherd is beside me,
			And nothing can I lack.
			His wisdom ever waketh,
			His sight is never dim;
			He knows the way he taketh,
			And I will; walk with him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Green pastures are before me,
			Which yet I have not seen;
			Bright skies will soon be o'er me,
			Where the darkest clouds have been.
			My path to life is free;
			My Saviour has my treasure,
			And he will walk with me.
		</verse>
