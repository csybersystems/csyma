		<verse>
			Star of our hope! He'll soon appear,
			The last loud trumpet speaks Him near;
			Hail Him, all saints, from pole to pole-
			How welcome to the faithful soul!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			From heaven angelic voices sound:
			Behold the Lord of glory crowned,
			Arrayed in majesty divine,
			And in His highest glories shine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The grave yields up its precious trust,
			Which long has slumbered in the dust,
			Resplendent forms ascending, fair,
			Now meet the Savior in the air.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Descending with His azure throne,
			He claims the kingdom for His own;
			The saints rejoice, they shout, they sing,
			And hail Him their triumphant King.
		</verse>
