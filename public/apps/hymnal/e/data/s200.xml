		<verse>
			The Lord is coming, let this be
			The herald note of jubilee;
			And when we meet and when we part
			The salutation from the heart.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			The Lord is coming, let this be
			The herald note of jubilee,
			The herald note of jubilee.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			The Lord is coming! sound it forth
			From east to west, from south to north;
			Speed on! speed on the tidings glad,
			That none who love Him may be sad.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord is coming, swift and sure
			And all His judgments shall endure,
			And none can hope to escape
			His wrath, Who walk not in the narrow path.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This earth, with her ten thousand wrongs
			Will soon be tuned to nobler songs;
			Our praise shall then, in realms of light,
			With all His universe unite.
		</verse>
