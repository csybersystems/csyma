	<eTitle>SEEKING THE LOST -- Luke 15, NASB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			"What man among you,
			if he has a hundred sheep
			and has lost one of them,
			does not leave the ninety-nine
			in the open pasture,
			and go after the one which is lost,
			until he finds it?"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"And when he comes home,
			he calls together his friends
			and his neighbors, saying to them,
			'Rejoice with me,
			for I have found my sheep which was lost!'
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I tell you that in the same way,
			there will be more joy in heaven
			over one sinner who repents,
			than over ninety-nine righteous persons
			who need no repentance.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins
			and loses one coin, does not light a lamp 
			and sweep the house
			and search carefully until she finds it?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"And when she has found it,
			she calls together her friends and neighbors,
			saying, 'Rejoice with me,
			for 1 have found the coin which I had lost!'
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"In the same way, I tell you, 
			there is joy in the presence
			of the angels of God
			over one sinner who repents."
