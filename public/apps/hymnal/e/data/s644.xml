	<verses>
		<verse>
			O God, whose will is life and good
			For all of mortal breath:
			Unite in bonds of servanthood
			All those who strive with death.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Make strong their hands and hearts and wills
			To drive disease afar,
			To strive against the body's ills
			And wage Your healing war.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			By healing of the sick and blind,
			Christ's mercy they proclaim,
			Make known the great physician's mind,
			Affirm the Savior's name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Before them set Your gracious will,
			That they, with heart and soul,
			To You may consecrate their skill
			And make the sufferer whole.
		</verse>
