	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Lord, lift me up, and I shall stand
			By faith, on heaven's table land;
			A higher plane than I have found;
			Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I'm pressing on the upward way,
			New heights I'm  gaining every day;
			Still praying as I onward bound,
			"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My heart has no desire to stay
			Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
			Though some may dwell where these abound,
			My prayer, my aim is higher ground.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I want to live above the world,
			Though Satan's darts at me hurled;
			For faith has caught the joyful sound,
			The song of saints on higher ground.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I want to scale the utmost height,
			And catch a gleam of glory bright;
			But still I'll pray till heaven I've found,
			"Lord, lead me on to higher ground."
		</verse>
