	<verses>
		<verse>
			Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,
			God of glory, Lord of love;
			Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee,
			Hail Thee as the sun above.
			Melt the clouds of sin and sadness,
			Drive the dark of doubt away;
			Giver of immortal gladness,
			Fill us with the light of day!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All Thy works with joy surround Thee,
			Earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays,
			Stars and angels sing around Thee,
			Center of unbroken praise;
			Field and forest, vale and mountain,
			Bloss'ming meadow, flashing sea,
			Chanting bird and flowing fountain
			Call us to rejoice in Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou art giving and forgiving,
			Ever blessing, ever blest,
			Wellspring of the joy of living,
			Oceandepth of happy rest!
			Thou the father, Christ our Brother -
			All who live in love are Thine:
			Teach us how to love each other,
			Lift us to the joy divine.
		</verse>
