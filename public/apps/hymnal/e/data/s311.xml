		<verse>
			Earthly pleasure vainly call me;
			I would be like Jesus;
			Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;
			I would be like Jesus.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Be like Jesus, this my song,
			In the home and in the throng;
			Be like Jesus, all day long!
			I would be like Jesus.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			He has broken every fetter,
			I would be like Jesus;
			That my soul may serve Him better,
			I would be like Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All the way from earth to glory,
			I would be like Jesus;
			Telling o'r and o'r the story,
			I would be like Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			That in heaven He may meet me,
			I would be like Jesus;
			That His words "Well done" may greet me,
			I would be like Jesus.
			Would be like Jesus.
		</verse>
