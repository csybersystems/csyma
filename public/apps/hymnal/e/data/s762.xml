	<eTitle>JUSTIFICATION -- Romans 4 and 5, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			[Jesus] was delivered over to death	for our sins
			and was raised to life for our justification.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore, since we have been justified through faith,
			we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
			through whom we have gained access by faith
			into this grace in which we now stand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
			Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings,
			because we know that suffering produces perseverance;
			perseverance, character; and character, hope.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And hope does not disappoint us,
			because God has poured out his love
			into our hearts by the Holy Spirit,
			whom he has given us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You see, at just the right time,
			when we were still powerless,
			Christ died for the ungodly.
			Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man,
			though for a good man someone
			might possibly dare to die.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But God demonstrates his own love for us in this:
			While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
			Since we have now been justified by his blood,
			how much more shall we be saved
			from God's wrath through him!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For if, when we were God's enemies,
			we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son,
			how much more, having been reconciled,
			shall we be saved through his life!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Not only is this so,
			but we also rejoice in God through
			our Lord Jesus Christ,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			through whom we have now
			received reconciliation.
