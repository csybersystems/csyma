	<verses>
		<verse>
			Just as I am, without one plea,
			But that Thy blood was shed for me,
			And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,
			O Lamb of God, I come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just as I am, and waiting not
			To rid my soul of one dark blot,
			To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
			O Lamb of God, I come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just as I am, though tossed about
			With many a conflict, many a doubt;
			"Fightings within, and fears without,"
			O Lamb of God, I come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
			Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
			Yea, all I need, in Thee I find,
			O Lamb of God, I come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
			Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
			Because Thy promise I believe,
			O Lamb of God, I come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just as I am, Thy love I own
			Has broken every barier down;
			Now to be Thine, and Thine alone,
			O Lamb of God, I come.
		</verse>
