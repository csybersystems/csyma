	<eTitle>ARISE, SHINE -- Isaiah 60, Jerusalem</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Arise, shine out, for your light has come,
			the glory of Yahweh is rising on you,
			though night still covers the earth
			and darkness the peoples.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Above you Yahweh now rises and
			above you his glory appears.
			The nations come to your light
			and kings to your dawning brightness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lift up your eyes and look round:
			all are assembling and coming towards you,
			your sons from far away and your daughters
			being tenderly carried.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			At this sight you will grow radiant,
			your heart throbbing and full; since the:
			riches of the sea will flow to you,
			the wealth of the nations come to you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though you have been abandoned,
			and hated and shunned,
			I will make you an eternal pride,
			a joy for ever and ever.
		</verse>
