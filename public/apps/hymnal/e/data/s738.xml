	<eTitle>OUR UNDERSTANDING PRIEST -- Hebrews 2, 4, and 6, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			We see Jesus,
			who was made a little lower than the angels,
			now crowned with glory and honor 
			because he suffered death,
			so that by the grace of God
			he might taste death for everyone.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For this reason he had to be made
			like his brothers in every way,
			in order that he might become a merciful 
			and faithful high priest in service to God,
			and that he might make atonement for 
			the sins of the people.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Because he himself suffered
			when he was tempted,
			he is able to help those 
			who are being tempted.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore, since we have a great high priest
			who has gone through the heavens,
			Jesus the Son of God,	
			let us hold firmly to the faith we profess....
			Let us then approach the throne of
			grace with confidence,	
			so that we may receive mercy and
			find grace to help us in our time of need.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We have this hope as an anchor for
			the soul, firm and secure.
		</verse>
