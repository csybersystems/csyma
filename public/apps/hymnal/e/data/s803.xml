	<eTitle>PRAISE IS RIGHTFULLY YOURS -- Psalm 65, Jerusalem</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Praise is rightfully yours, God, in Zion.
			Vows to you must be fulfilled,
			for you answer prayer.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All flesh must come to you with all its sins;
			though our faults overpower us,
			you blot them out.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Happy the man you choose, whom
			you invite to live in your courts.
			Fill us with the good things of your house,
			of your holy Temple.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Your righteousness repays us with marvels,
			God our saviour, hope of all the ends of
			the earth and the distant islands.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Your strength holds the mountains up,
			such is the power that wraps you;
			you calm the clamour of the ocean,
			the clamour of its waves.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The nations are un uproar,
			in panic those who live at the ends of the world,
			as your miracles bring shouts of joy
			to the portals of morning and evening.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You visit the earth and water it,
			you load it with riches;
			God's rivers brim with water
			to provide their grain.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This is how you provide it:
			by drenching its furrows,
			by levelling its ridges,
			by softening it with showers,
			by blessing the first-fruits.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You crown the year with your bounty,
			abundance flows wherever you pass;
			the desert pastures overflow,
			the hillsides are wrapped in joy,
			the meadows are dressed in flocks,
			the valleys are clothed in wheat,
			what shouts of joy, what singing!
		</verse>
