	<verses>
		<verse>
			Let love be genuine; hate what is evil,
			hold fast to what is good;
			love one another with brotherly affection;
			outdo one another in showing honor.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Never Bag in zeal, but aglow with the Spirit,
			serve the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Rejoice in your hope, be patient
			in tribulation, be constant in prayer.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Contribute to the needs of the saints,
			practice hospitality.
			Bless those who persecute you;
			bless and do not curse them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Rejoice with those who rejoice,
			weep with those who weep.
			Live in harmony with one another;
			do not be haughty,
			but associate with the lowly;
			never be conceited.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Repay no one evil for evil,
			but take thought for what is noble in
			the sight of all.
			If possible, so far as it depends upon you,
			live peaceably with all.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Beloved, never avenge yourselves,
			but leave it to the wrath of God;
			for it is written,
			"Vengeance is mine, I 'will repay,
			says the Lord."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			No, "if your enemy is hungry, feed him;
			if he is thirsty, give him drink;
			for by so doing you will heap burning coals
			upon his head."
		</verse>
