		<verse>
			O God, our help in ages past,
			our hope for years to come,
			our shelter from the stormy blast,
			and our eternal home!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Under the shadow of thy throne,
			still may we dwell secure;
			sufficient is thine arm alone,
			and our defense is sure.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Before the hills in order stood,
			or earth received her frame,
			from everlasting, thou art God,
			to endless years the same.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A thousand ages, in thy sight,
			are like an evening gone;
			short as the watch that ends the night,
			before the rising sun.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O God, our help in ages past,
			our hope for years to come;
			be thou our guide while life shall last,
			and our eternal home!
		</verse>
