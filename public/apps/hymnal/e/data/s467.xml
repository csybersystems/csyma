	<eTitle>Life Is Great! So Sing About It</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Life is great! So sing about it,
			As we can and as we should-
			Shop and buses, towns and people,
			Village, farmland, field and wood,
			Life is great and life is given;
			Life is lovely, free and good.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Life is great!- what ever happens,
			Snow or sunshine, joy or pain,
			Hardship, grief or disillusion,
			Suffering that I can't explain-
			Life is great if someone loves me,
			Holds my hand and calls my name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Love is great!- the love of lovers,
			Whispered words and longing eyes;
			Love that gazes at the cradle
			Where a child of loving lies;
			Love that lasts when youth has faded,
			Bends with age, but never dies.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Love is giving and receiving-
			Boy and girl, or friend with friend;
			Love is bearing and forgiving
			All the hurts that hate can send;
			Love's the greatest way of living,
			Hoping, trusting to the end.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God is great! in  Christ He loved us,
			As we should, but never can-
			Love that suffered, hoped and trusted
			When disciples turned and ran,
			Love that broke through death forever.
			Praise that loving, living Man!
		</verse>
