		<verse>
			For God so loved us,
			He sent the Savior:
			For God so loved us,
			and loves me too.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Love so unending!
			I'll sing His praises,
			God loves His children,
			loves even me.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			He sent the Savior,
			the blest Redeemer;
			He sent the Savior
			to set me free.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He bade me welcome,
			O word of mercy;
			He bade me welcome,
			O voice divine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Glory and honor,
			O Love eternal,
			To Him be given
			while life shall last.
		</verse>
