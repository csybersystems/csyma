		<verse>
			God, be merciful to me,
			On Thy grace I rest my plea;
			Plenteous in compassion Thou,
			Blot out my transgressions now;
			Wash me, make me pure within,
			Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin,
			Wash me, make me pure within,
			Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I am evil, born in sin;
			Thou desirest truth within.
			Thou alone my Savior art,
			Teach Thy wisdom to my heart;
			Make me pure, Thy grace bestow,
			Wash me whiter than the snow,
			Make me pure, Thy grace bestow,
			Wash me whiter than the snow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Gracious God, my heart renew,
			Make my spirit right and true;
			Cast me not away from Thee,
			Let Thy Spirit dwell in me;
			Thy salvation's joy impart,
			Steadfast make my willing heart,
			Thy salvation's joy impart,
			Steadfast make my willing heart.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sinners then shall learn from me
			And return, O God, to Thee;
			Savior, all my guilt remove,
			And my tongue shall sing Thy love;
			Touch my silent lips, O Lord,
			And my mouth shall praise accord,
			Touch my silent lips, O Lord,
			And my mouth shall praise accord.
		</verse>
