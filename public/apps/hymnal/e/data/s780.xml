	<eTitle>THE THREE ANGELS' MESSAGES -- Revelation 14, KJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,
			having the everlasting gospel
			to preach unto them that dwell on the earth,
			and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue,
			and people, saying with a loud voice,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Fear God, and give glory to him;
			for the hour of his judgment is come:
			and worship him that made heaven, and earth,
			and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And there followed another angel,
			saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen,
			that great city,
			because she made all nations drink of the wine
			of the wrath of her fornication.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And the third angel followed them,
			saying with a loud voice,
			If any man worship the beast and his image,
			and receive his mark in his	forehead,
			or in his hand,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			the same shall drink of the wine
			of the wrath of God,
			which is poured out without mixture
			into the cup of his indignation;
			and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone
			in the presence of the holy angels,
			and in the presence of the Lamb:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			and the smoke of their torment
			ascendeth up for ever and ever:
			and they have no rest day nor night,
			who worship the beast and of his image,
			and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Here is the patience of the saints:
			here are they that keep the commandments of God,
			and the faith of Jesus.
		</verse>
