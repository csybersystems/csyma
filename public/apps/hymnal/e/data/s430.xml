		<refrain>
			Joy, joy, there'll be joy by and by,
			       Joy, joy, joy,       joy by and by,
			Joy, joy, where the joys never die;
			       Joy, joy, joy,        joys never die;
			Joy, joy; for the day draweth  nigh
			       Joy, joy, joy,
			When the workers gather home.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			O there'll be joy when the work is done,
			Joy when the reapers gather home,
			Bringing the sheaves at set of sun
			To the new Jerusalem.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sweet are the songs that we hope to sing,
			Grateful the thanks our hearts shall bring,
			Praising forever Christ our King
			In the New Jerusalem.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Pure are the joys that await us there,
			Many the golden mansions fair;
			Jesus Himself doth  them prepare,
			In the New Jerusalem.
		</verse>
