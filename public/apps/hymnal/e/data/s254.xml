	<verses>
		<verse>
			The great Physician now is near,
			The sympathizing Jesus;
			He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
			Oh! hear the voice of Jesus.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Sweetest note in seraph song,
			Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
			Sweetest carol ever sung,
			Jesus, blessed Jesus.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Your many sins are all forgiven,
			Oh! hear the voice of Jesus;
			Go on your way in peace to heaven,
			And wear a crown with Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All glory to the dying Lamb!
			I now believe in Jesus;
			I love the blessed Savior's name,
			I love the name of Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His name dispels my guilt and fear,
			No other name but Jesus;
			Oh! how my soul delights to hear
			The charming name of Jesus.
		</verse>
