	<verses>
		<verse>
			Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life:
			Such a Way, as gives us breath;
			Such a Truth, as ends all strife;
			Such a Life, as killeth death.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, my Light, my Feast, my Strength:
			Such a Light, as shows a feast;
			Such a Feast, as mends in length;
			Such a Strength, as makes His guest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart:
			Such a Joy, as none can move;
			Such a Love, as none can part;
			Such a Heart, as joys in love.
		</verse>
