		<verse>
			Good Christians, now rejoice,
			With heart, and soul, and voice;
			Give ye heed to what we say:
			Jesus Christ is born today;
			Ox and ass before Him bow,
			And He is in the manger now.
			Crist is born today!
			Crist is born today!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Good Christians, now rejoice,
			With heart, and soul, and voice;
			Now ye hear of endless bliss:
			Jesus Christ was born for this!
			He hath ope'd the heav'nly door,
			And we are blessed evermore.
			Christ was born for this!
			Christ was born for this!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Good Christians, now rejoice,
			With heart, and soul, and voice;
			Now ye need not fear the grave:
			Jesus Christ was born to save!
			Calls you one and calls you all
			To gain His everlasting hall.
			Christ was born to save!
			Christ was born to save!
		</verse>
