	<verses>
		<verse>
			The head that once was crowned with thorns
			Is crowned with glory now;
			A royal diadem adorns
			The mighty victor's brow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The highest place that heaven affords
			Is His, is His by right;
			The King of kings, and Lord of lords,
			And heaven's eternal light.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The joy of all who dwell above,
			The joy of all below,
			To whom He manifests His love,
			And grants His name to know.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To them the cross, with all its shame,
			With all its grace is given;
			Their name an everlasting name,
			Their joy the joy of heaven.
		</verse>
