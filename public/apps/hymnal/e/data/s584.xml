		<verse>
			There's a Spirit in the air,
			Telling Christians everywhere
			"Praise the love that Christ revealed,
			Living, working in our world."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lose your shyness, find your tongue;
			Tell the world what God has done:
			God in Christ has come to stay,
			We can see His pow'r today.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When believers break the bread
			When a hungry child is fed:
			Praise the love that Christ revealed
			Living, working in our world.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Still His Spirit leads the fight,
			Seeing wrong and setting right:
			God in Christ has come to stay,
			We can see His pow'r today.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When a stranger's not a alone,
			Where the homeless find a home,
			Praise the love that Christ revealed,
			Living, working in our world.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May His Spirit fill our praise,
			Guide our thougths and change our ways.
			God in Christ has come to stay,
			We can see His power today.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There's a Spirit in the air,
			Calling people everywhere;
			Praise the love that Christ revealed:
			Living, working in our world.
