			In the morning when I rise,
			In the morning when I rise,
			In the morning when I rise,
			Give me Jesus.

		<refrain>
			Give me Jesus, Give me Jesus,
			You may have all this world,
			Give me Jesus.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Dark midnight was my cry,
			Dark midnight was my cry,
			Dark midnight was my cry,
			Give me Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just about the break of day,
			Just about the break of day,
			Just about the break of day,
			Give me Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Oh, when I come to die,
			Oh, when I come to die,
			Oh, when I come to die,
			Give me Jesus.
