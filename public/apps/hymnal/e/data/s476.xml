	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Burdens are lifted at Calvary, Calvary, Calvary;
			Burdens are lifted at Calvary, Jesus is very near.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Days are filled with sorrow and care,
			Hearts are lonely and drear;
			Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
			Jesus is very near.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Cast your care on Jesus today,
			Leave your worry and fear;
			Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
			Jesus is very near.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Troubled soul, the Savior can see
			Every heartache and tear;
			Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
			Jesus is very near.
		</verse>
