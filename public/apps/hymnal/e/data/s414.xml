	<verses>
		<verse>
			Fruitful trees, the Spirit's sowing,
			May we ripen and increase,
			Fruit to life eternal growing,
			Rich in love and joy and peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Laden branches freely bearing
			Gifts the Giver loves to bless;
			Here is fruit that grows by sharing,
			Patience, kindness, gentleness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Rooted deep in Christ, our Master,
			Christ, our pattern and our goal,
			Teach us, as the years fly faster,
			Goodness, faith, and self control.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Fruitful trees, the Spirit's tending,
			May we grow till harvests cease;
			Till we taste, in life unending,
			Heaven's love and joy and peace.
		</verse>
