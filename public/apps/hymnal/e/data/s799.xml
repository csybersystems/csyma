	<eTitle>DO NOT WORRY -- Psalm 37, Jerusalem.</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Do not worry about the wicked,
			do not envy those who do wrong.
			Quick as the grass they wither,
			fading like the green in the field.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Trust in Yahweh and do what is good,
			make your home in the land and live in peace;
			make Yahweh your only joy and he will give you
			what your heart desires.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Commit your fate to Yahweh,
			trust in him and he will act:
			making your virtue clear as the light,
			your integrity as bright as noon.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be quiet before Yahweh,
			and wait patiently for him,
			not worrying about men who make their fortunes,
			about men who scheme to bring
			the poor and needy down.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Enough of anger, leave rage aside,
			do not worry, nothing but evil can come of it:
			for the wicked will be expelled,
			while those who hope in Yahweh
			shall have the land for their own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A little longer, and the wicked will be no more,
			search his place well, he will not be there:
			but the humble shall have the land for their own
			to enjoy untroubled peace.
		</verse>
