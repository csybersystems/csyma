	<verses>
		<refrain>
			I want my friends to pray for me,
			To bear my tempted soul above,
			And intercede with God for me,
			I need the prayers of those I love.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I need the prayers of those I love,
			While trav'ling o'er life's rugged way,
			That I may true and faithful be,
			And live for Jesus every day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I need the prayers of those I love,
			To help me in each trying hour,
			To bear my tempted soul to Him,
			That He may keep me by His power.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I want my friends to pray for me,
			To hold me up on wings of faith,
			That I may walk the narrow way,
			Kept by our Father's glorious grace.
		</verse>
