	<verses>
		<verse>
			Father, who on us do shower
			Gifts of plenty from Your dower,
			To Your people give the power
			All Your gifts to use aright.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Give pure happiness in leisure
			Temperance in every pleasure,
			Wholesome use of earthly treasure
			Bodies clean and spirits bright.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lift from this and every nation
			All that brings us degradation;
			Quell the forces of temptation;
			Put Your enemies to flight.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Father, You who sought and found us,
			Son of God, whose love has bound us,
			Holy Spirit, in us, round us,
			Hear us, Godhead infinite.
		</verse>
