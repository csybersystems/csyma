	<verses>
		<refrain>
			I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,
			O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;
			I'll say what You want me to say, dear Lord,
			I'll be what You want me to be.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			It may not be on the mountain's height,
			Or over the stormy sea;
			It may not be at the battle's front
			My Lord will have need of me;
			But if by a still, small voice He calls
			To path I do not know
			I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in Thine
			I'll go where You want me to go.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Perhaps today there are loving words
			Which Jesus would have me speak;
			There may be now, in the paths of sin,
			Some wand'rer whom I should seek
			O Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide,
			Tho' dark and rugged  the way,
			My voice shall echo the message sweet
			I'll say what You want me to say.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There's surely somewhere a lowly place
			In earth's harvest fields sop wide,
			Where I may labor thro' life short day
			For Jesus, the Crucified.
			So, trusting my all unto Thy care,
			I know Thou lovest me!
			I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
			I'll be what You want me to be.
		</verse>
