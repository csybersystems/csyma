	<verses>
		<verse>
			Finally, build up your strength in union
			with the Lord and by means of his mighty power.
			Put on all the armor that God gives you,
			so that you will be able to stand up
			against the Devil's evil tricks.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For we are not fighting against human beings
			but against the wicked spiritual
			forces in the heavenly world,	
			the rulers, authorities, and cosmic
			powers of this dark age.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So put on God's armor now!
			Then when the evil day comes,
			you will be able to resist the enemy's attacks,
			and after fighting to the end,
			you will still hold your ground.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So stand ready,
			with truth as a belt tight around your waist,
			with righteousness as your breastplate,
			and as your shoes the readiness to announce
			the Good News of peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			At all times carry faith as a shield;
			for with it you will be able to put out
			all the burning arrows shot by the Evil One.
			And accept salvation as a helmet,
			and the word of God as the sword
			which the Spirit gives you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Do all this in prayer, asking for God's help.
			Pray on every occasion, as the Spirit leads.
			For this reason keep alert and never give up;
			pray always for all God's people.
		</verse>
