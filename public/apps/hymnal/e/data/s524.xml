	<eTitle>'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
			How I've proved him o'er and o'er! 
			Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
			O for grace to trust him more!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
			and to take him at his word;
			just to rest upon his promise,
			and to know, "Thus saith the Lord."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
			just to trust his cleansing blood;
			and in simple faith to plunge me
			neath the healing, cleansing flood!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
			just from sin and self to cease;
			just from Jesus simply taking
			life and rest, and joy and peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I'm so glad I learned to trust thee,
			precious Jesus, Savior, friend;
			and I know that thou art with me,
			wilt be with me to the end.
		</verse>
