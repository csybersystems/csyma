	<eTitle>GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD -- Psalm 105, NASB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Oh give thanks to the Lord, call upon His name;
			Make known His deeds among the peoples.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; 
			Speak of all His wonders.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Glory in His holy name;
			Let the heart of those who seek the Lord be glad.
			Seek the Lord and His strength; 
			Seek His face continually.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Remember His wonders which He as done,
			His marvels, and the judgments uttered by His mouth, 
			O seed of Abraham, His servant, 
			O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He is the Lord our God;
			His judgments are in all the earth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He has remembered His covenant forever,
			The word which He commanded
			to a thousand generations.
		</verse>
