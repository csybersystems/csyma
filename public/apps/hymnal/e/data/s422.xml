		<refrain>
			We're marching to Zion
			Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
			We're marching upward to Zion
			The beautiful city of God
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Come, we that love the Lord,
			and let our joys be known;
			join in a song with sweet accord,
			join in a song with sweet accord,
			and thus surround the throne.
			and thus surround the throne.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let those refuse to sing
			who never knew our God;
			but children of the heavenly King
			but children of the heavenly King
			may speak their joys abroad.
			may speak their joys abroad.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The hill of Zion yields
			a thousand sacred sweets
			before we reach the heavenly fields,
			before we reach the heavenly fields,
			or walk the golden streets.
			or walk the golden streets.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then let our songs abound,
			and every tear be dry;
			we're marching through Emmanuel's ground,
			we're marching through Emmanuel's ground,
			to fairer worlds on high.
			to fairer worlds on high.
		</verse>
