	<eTitle>A SONG OF TRIUMPH -- Revelation 7, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			I looked and there before me was a
			great multitude that no one could count,
			from every nation, tribe, people and language,
			standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb.
			They were wearing white robes
			and were holding palm branches in their hands.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And they cried out in a loud voice:
			"Salvation belongs to our God,
			who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All the angels were standing around the throne
			and around the elders and the four living creatures.
			They fell down on their faces before the throne
			and worshiped God, saying:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and 
			thanks and honor and power and strength
			be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then one of the elders asked me,
			"These in white robes who are they,
			and where did they come from?"
			I answered, "Sir, you know."
			And he said, "These are they who
			have come out of the great tribulation;
			they have washed their robes and made them white
			in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"they are before the throne of God
			and serve him day and night in his temple;
			and he who sits on the throne
			will spread his tent over them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Never again will they hunger;
			never again will they thirst.
			The sun will not beat upon them,
			nor any scorching heat.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"For the Lamb at the center of
			the throne will be their shepherd;
			he will lead them to springs of	living water.
			And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
		</verse>
