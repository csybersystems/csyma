	<verses>
		<refrain>
			It is well with my soul,
			it is well, it is well with my soul.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
			when sorrows like sea billows roll;
			whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
			It is well, it is well with my soul.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My sin, -oh, the joy of this glorious thought-
			My sin, not in part but the whole,
			is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
			praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
			the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
			the trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
			even so, it is well with my soul.
		</verse>
