	<verses>
		<verse>
			Take the world, but give me Jesus;
			All its Joys are but a name,
			But His love abideth ever,
			Through eternal years the same.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Oh, the height and depth of mercy!
			Oh, the length and breadth of love!
			Oh, the fullness of redemption,
			Pledge of endless life above
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Take the world, but give me Jesus,
			Sweetest comfort of my soul;
			With my Savior watching o'er me,
			I can sing, though billows roll.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Take the world, but give me Jesus;
			Let me view his constant smile;
			Then throughout my pilgrim journey
			Light will cheer me all the while.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Take the world, but give me Jesus;
			In His cross my trust shall be
			Till, with clearer, brighter vision,
			Face to face my Lord I see.
		</verse>
