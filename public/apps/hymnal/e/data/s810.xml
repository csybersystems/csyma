	<verses>
		<verse>
			Let our people learn to apply them
			selves to good deeds,
			so as to help cases of urgent need,
			and not to be unfruitful.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			They are to do good,
			to be rich in good deeds,
			liberal and generous,
			thus laying up for themselves a
			good foundation for the future,
			so that they may take hold of the life
			which is life indeed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I desire you to insist on these things,
			so that those who have believe in God may
			be careful to apply themselves to good deeds;
			these are excellent and profitable to men.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We must all appear before the
			judgment seat of Christ,	
			so that each one may receive good or evil,
			according to what he has done in the body.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Fear God, and keep his commandments;
			for this is the whole duty of man.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For God will bring every deed into judgment,
			with every secret thing, whether good or evil.
		</verse>
