	<eTitle>THE LIBERATING CREATOR -- Isaiah -12. NEB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Thus speaks the Lord who is God,
			he who created the skies and stretched them out,
			who fashioned the earth and all that grows in it,
			who gave breath to its people,
			the breath of life to all who walk upon it:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I, the Lord, have called you with righteous 
			purpose and taken you by the hand;
			I have formed you, and appointed you 
			to be a light to all peoples,
			a beacon for the nations,
			to open eyes that are blind,
			to bring captives out of prison,
			out of the dungeons where they lie in darkness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I am the Lord; the Lord is my name;
			I will not give my glory to another god,
			nor my praise to any idol.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			See how the first prophecies have come to pass,
			and now I declare new things;
			before they break from the bud
			I announce them to you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sing a new song to the Lord,
			sing his praise throughout the earth,
			you that sail the sea, and all sea creatures,
			and you that inhabit the coasts and islands.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let the wilderness and its towns rejoice,
			and the villages of the tribe of Kedar.
			Let those who live in Sela shout for joy
			and cry out from the hill-tops.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You coasts and islands, all uplift his praises;
			let all ascribe glory to the Lord.
		</verse>
