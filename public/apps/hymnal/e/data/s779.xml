	<eTitle>DAY OF JUDGMENT -- Daniel 7 and Revelation 20 through 22, Jerusalem.</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			"Thrones were set in place
			and one of great age took his seat.
			His robe was white as snow,
			the hair of his head as pure as wool.
			His throne was a blaze of flames,
			its wheels were a burning fire.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"A stream of fire poured out,
			issuing from his presence.
			A thousand thousand waited on him,
			ten thousand times ten thousand
			stood before him.
			A court was held and the books were opened."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I saw the dead, both great and small,
			standing in front of his throne,
			while the book of life was opened,
			and other books opened which were the record
			of what they had done in their lives,
			by which the dead were judged.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth;
			the first heaven and the first earth
			had disappeared now,
			and there was no longer any sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I saw the holy city, and the new Jerusalem,
			coming down from God out of heaven
			as beautiful as a bride all dressed for	her husband.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Here God lives among men.
			He will make his home among them;
			they shall be his people,
			and he will be their God;
			his name is God-with-them."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Very soon now, I shall be with	you again,
			bringing the reward to be given
			to every man according to what he deserves."
		</verse>
