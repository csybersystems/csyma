		<verse>
			Redeemed! how I love to proclaim it!
			Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
			Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
			His child, and forever, I am.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Redeemed, (Redeemed), redeemed, (Redeemed),
			Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
			Redeemed, (Redeemed), redeemed, (Redeemed),
			His child, and forever, I am.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Redeemed! and so happy in Jesus!
			No language my rapture can tell;
			I know that the light of His presence
			With me doth continually dwell.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I know there's a crown that is waiting
			In yonder bright mansion for me;
			And soon, with the saints made perfect,
			At home with the Lord I shall be.
		</verse>
