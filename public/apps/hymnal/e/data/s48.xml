		<verse>
			Softly now the light of day
			Fades upon our sight away:
			Free from care, from labor free,
			Lord, we would commune with Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou, whose all pervading eye
			Nought escapes, without, within,
			Pardon each infirmity,
			Open fault, and secret sin.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Soon from us the light of day
			Shall forever pass away;
			Then, from sin and sorrow free,
			Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.
		</verse>
