	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus invites His saints
			To meet around His board,
			And sup in memory of the death
			And sufferings of their Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We take the bread and wine
			As emblems of Thy death;
			Lord, raise our souls above the sign,
			To feast on Thee by faith.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Faith eats the bread of life,
			And drinks the living wine;
			It looks beyond this scene of strife
			Unites us to the Vine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Soon shall the night be gone,
			Our Lord will come again;
			The marriage supper of the Lamb
			Will usher in His reign.
		</verse>
