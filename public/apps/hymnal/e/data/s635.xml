		<verse>
			Lord of all good, our gifts we bring You now;
			Use them Your holy purpose to fulfill.
			Tokens of love and pledges they shall be
			That our whole life is offered to Your will.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We give our minds to understand Your ways;
			Hands, voices, eyes to serve Your great design;
			Hearts with the flame of your own love ablaze:
			Thus for Your glory all our pow'rs combine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Father, whose bounty all creation shows;
			Christ, by whose willing sacrifice we live;
			Spirit, from whom all life in fullness flows:
			To You with grateful hearts ourselves we give.
		</verse>
