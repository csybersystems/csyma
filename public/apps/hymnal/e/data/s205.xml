		<refrain>
			O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
			piercing thro' this night of gloom!
			O, see the gleams of the golden morning
			that will burst the tomb.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			The golden morning is fast approaching;
			Jesus soon will come
			To take his faithful and happy children
			to their promised home
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The gospel summons will soon be carried
			to the nations round;
			The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry
			and the trumpet sound.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Attended by all the shining angels,
			Down the flaming sky
			the Judge will come, and will take his people
			where they will not die.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The lov'd of earth who have long been parted
			Meet in that glad day;
			The tears of those who are broken hearted
			shall be wiped away.
		</verse>
