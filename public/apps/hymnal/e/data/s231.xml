	<verses>
		<verse>
			Bless be the King whose coming Is in the name of God!
			For Him let doors be opened, No hearts against Him barred!
			Not robed in royal splendor, In power and pomp comes He;
			But clad as are teh poorest, Such his humility.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			By those who truly listen His voice is truly heard;
			Pitty the proud and haughty Who have not learned to heed
			The Christ who is the promise, Who has atonement made.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He only to the humbled Reveals th face of God
			All power is His, all glory! All things are in His hand,
			All ages and all peoples, Till time itself shall end.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He offers to the burdened The rest and grace they need.
			Gentle is He and humbled! And light His yoke shall be,
			For He would have us bear it So He can make us free!
		</verse>
