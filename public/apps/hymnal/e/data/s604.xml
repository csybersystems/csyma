	<verses>
		<refrain>
			He will come, let us watch and be ready;
			He will come, hallelujah! hallelujah!
			He will come in the clouds of His Father's
			bright glory but we know not the hour.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			We know not the hour of the Master's appearing;
			Yet signs all foretell that the moment is nearing
			When He shall return 'tis the promise most cheering
			But we know not the hour.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There's light for the wise who are seeking salvation;
			There's truth in the book of the Lord's revelation;
			Each prophecy points to the great comsummation
			But we know not the hour.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We'll watch and we'll pray,
			with our lamps trimmed and burning;
			We'll work and we'll wait till the Master's returning;
			We'll sing and rejoice, every omen discerning
			But we know not the hour.
		</verse>
