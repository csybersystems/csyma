	<verses>
		<verse>
			As with gladness, men of old
			Did the guiding star behold
			As with joy they hailed its light
			Leading onward, beaming bright
			So, most glorious Lord, may we
			Evermore be led to Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As with joyful steps they sped
			To that lowly manger bed
			There to bend the knee before
			Him Whom heaven and earth adore;
			So may we with willing feet
			Ever seek Thy mercy seat.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As they offered gifts most rare
			At that manger rude and bare;
			So may we with holy joy,
			Pure and free from sin's alloy,
			All our costliest treasures bring,
			Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy Jesus, every day
			Keep us in the narrow way;
			And, when earthly things are past,
			Bring our ransomed souls at last
			Where they need no star to guide,
			Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
		</verse>
