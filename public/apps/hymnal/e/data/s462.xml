		<refrain>
			This is my story, this is my song,
			praising my Savior all the day long;
			this is my story, this is my song,
			praising my Savior all the day long.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
			O what a foretaste of glory divine!
			Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
			born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Perfect submission, perfect delight,
			visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
			angels descending bring from above
			echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Perfect submission, all is at rest;
			I in my Savior am happy and blest,
			watching and waiting, looking above,
			filled with his goodness, lost in his love.
		</verse>
