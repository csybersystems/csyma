	<verses>
		<verse>
			Let not your heart be troubled:
			ye believe in God, believe also in me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In my Father's house are many mansions:
			if it were not so, I would have told you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I go to prepare a place for you.
			And if I go and prepare a place for you,
			I will come again,
			and receive you unto myself;
			that where I am, there ye may be also.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			While they looked stedfastly toward 
			heaven as he went up, behold,
			two men stood by them in white apparel;
			which also said,

		<verse>
			Ye men of Galilee,
			Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
			this same Jesus, which is taken up
			from you into heaven,
			shall so come in like manner
			as ye have seen him go into heaven.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Watch therefore:
			for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But know this, that if the goodman
			of the house had known in what watch
			the thief would come, he would have watched,
			and would not have suffered his house
			to be broken up.
			Therefore be ye also ready:
			for in such an hour as ye think not
			the Son of man cometh.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who then is a faithful andwise serand wiser>
			whom his Lord hath made ruler over
			his household,
			to give them meat in due season?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Blessed is that servant,
			whom his Lord when he cometh
			shall Lind so doing.
