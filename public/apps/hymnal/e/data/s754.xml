	<eTitle>THE HOLY SCRIPTURES -- Deuteronomy 29, 2 Peter 1, 2 Timothy 3, John 5, Hebrews 4,and Jeremiah 15, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The secret things belong to the
			Lord our God, but those things which are
			revealed belong to us and to our'
			children forever, that we may do all
			the words of this law.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We also have the prophetic word made more sure,
			which you do well to heed as a light that shines
			in a dark place, until the day dawns
			and the morning star rises in your hearts;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			knowing this first,
			that no prophecy of Scripture
			is of any private interpretation,
			for prophecy never came by the will of man,
			but holy men of God spoke as they
			were moved by the Holy Spirit.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			From childhood you have known
			the Holy Scriptures,
			which are able to make you wise
			for salvation through faith
			which is in Christ Jesus.
		</verse>
