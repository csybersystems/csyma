			This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine,
			This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine,
			This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine,
			Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Everywhere I go, I'm going to let it shine,
			Everywhere I go, I'm going to let it shine,
			Everywhere I go, I'm going to let it shine,
			Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All through the night, I'm going to let it shine,
			All through the night, I'm going to let it shine,
			All through the night, I'm going to let it shine,
			Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
