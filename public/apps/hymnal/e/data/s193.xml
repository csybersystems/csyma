		<verse>
			Savior, teach me day by day,
			Love's sweet lesson to obey,
			Sweeter lesson cannot be,
			Loving Him who first loved me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With a child's glad heart of love,
			At Thy bidding may I move,
			Prompt to serve and follow Thee,
			Loving Him who first loved me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Teach me I am not my own,
			I am Thine, and Thine alone;
			Thine to keep, to rule, to save
			From all sin that would enslave.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Love in loving finds employ,
			In obedience all her joy;
			Ever new that joy will be,
			Loving Him who first loved me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Teach me thus Thy steps to trace,
			Strong to follow in Thy grace.
			Learning how to love from Thee,
			Loving Him who first loved me.
		</verse>
