		<verse>
			O gladsome light, O grace
			Of God the Father's face,
			The eternal splendor wearing;
			Celestial, holy, blest,
			Our Savior, Jesus Christ,
			Joyful in Thine appearing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now e'er day fadeth quite,
			We see the ev'ning light,
			Our wonted hymn outpouring;
			Father of might unknown,
			Thee His incarnate Son,
			And Holy Spirit adoring.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To Thee of right belongs
			All praise of holy songs,
			O Son of God, life giver;
			Thee therefore, O most high,
			The world doth glorify
			And shall exalt for ever.
		</verse>
