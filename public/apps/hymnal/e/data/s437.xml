		<refrain>
			I'm going home, I'm going home,
			I'm going home to die no more;
			To die no more; to die no more-
			I'm going home to die no more.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			My heav'nly home is bright and fair,
			Nor pain nor death can enter there;
			It's glitt'ring tow'rs the sun outshine,
			That heav'nly mansion shall me mine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My Father's house is built on high,
			Far, far above the starry  sky;
			When from this earthly prison free,
			That heav'nly mansion mine shall be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let others seek a home below,
			Which flames devour or waves oe'r flow;
			Be mine a happier lot to own
			A heav'nly mansion near the throne.
		</verse>
