			This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He's the One,
			This Rock is Jesus, The only One!
			Be very sure, be very sure
			Your anchor holds and grips the solid Rock!

			In times like these you need a Savior,
			In times like these you need an anchor;
			Be very sure, be very sure
			Your anchor holds and grips the solid Rock!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In times like these you need the Bible,
			In times like these O be not idle;
			Be very sure, be very sure
			Your anchor holds and grips the solid Rock!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In times like these I have a Savior,
			In times like these I have an anchor;
			I'm very sure, I'm very sure
			My anchor holds and grips the solid Rock!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He's the One,
			This Rock is Jesus, The only One!
			I'm very sure, I'm very sure
			My anchor holds and grips the solid Rock!
