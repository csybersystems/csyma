	<eTitle>THE CALL -- Isaiah 55, Jerusalem</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Oh, come to the water all you who are thirsty;
			though you have no money, come! Buy corn without money,
			and eat, and, at no cost, wine and milk.
			Why spend money on what is not bread,
			your wages on what fails to satisfy?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Listen, listen to me,
			and you will have good things to eat
			and rich food to enjoy.
			Pay attention, come to me; listen,
			and your soul will live.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Withyou I will make an everlasting covenant
			out of the favours promised	to David.
			See, I have made of you a witness to the peoples,
			a leader and a master of the nations.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			See, you will summon a nation you never knew,
			those unknown will come burrying
			to you, for the sake of Yahweh your God,
			of the Holy One of Israel
			who will glorify you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Seek Yahweh while he is still to be found,
			call to him while he is still near.
			Let the wicked man abandon his way,
			the evil man his thoughts.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let him turn back to Yahweh
			who will take pity on him,
			to our God who is rich in forgiving;
			for my thoughts are not your thoughts,
			my ways not your ways
			it is Yahweh who speaks.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yes, the heavens are as high above earth
			as my ways are above your ways,
			my thoughts above your thoughts.
		</verse>
