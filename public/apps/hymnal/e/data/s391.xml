		<verse>
			Welcome, welcome, day of rest,
			To the world in kindness given;
			Welcome to this humble breast,
			As the beaming light from heaven.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Day of calm and sweet repose,
			Gently now thy moments run;
			Balm to soothe our cares and woes,
			Till our labor here is done.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy day that most we prize,
			Day of solemn praise and prayer,
			Day to make the simple wise,
			O, how great thy blessings are!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Welcome, welcome, day of rest,
			With thy influence all divine;
			May thy hallowed hours be blessed
			to this waiting heart of mine.
		</verse>
