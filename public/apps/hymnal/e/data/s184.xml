		<verse>
			I hear the Savior say,
			"Thy strength indeed is small;
			Child of weakness, watch and pray,
			Find in Me thine all in all."
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Jesus paid it all,
					All to Him I owe;
					Sin had left a crimson stain;
					He washed it white as snow.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Lord, now indeed I find
			Thy power, and Thine alone,
			Can change the leper's spots,
			And melt the heart of stone.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Since nothing good have I
			Whereby Thy grace to claim,
			I'll wash my garment white
			In the blood of Calvary's Lamb.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And when before the throne
			I stand in Him complete,
			I'll lay my trophies down,
			All down at Jesus' feet.
		</verse>
