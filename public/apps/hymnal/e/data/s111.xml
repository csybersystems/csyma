	<verses>
		<verse>
			My Father is omnipotent,
			And that you can't deny;
			A God of might and miracles-
			'Tis written in the sky.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			It took a miracle to put  the stars in place,
			It took a miracle to hang the world in space;
					But when He saved my soul,
			Cleansed and made me whole,
			It took a miracle of love and grace!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Though here His glory has been shown,
			We still can't fully see
			The wonders of His might,
			His throne- 'Twill take eternity.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Bible tells us of His power
			And wisdom all way through,
			And every little bird and flower
			Are testimonies too.
		</verse>
