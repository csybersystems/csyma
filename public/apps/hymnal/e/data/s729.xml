	<eTitle>THE SAVIOUR IS COMING -- Isaiah 40, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			"Comfort, yes, comfort My people!"
			Says your God.
			"Speak comfort to Jerusalem,
			and cry out to her,
			That her warfare is ended,
			That her iniquity is pardoned;
			For she has received from the Lord's hand
			Double for all her sins."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
			"Prepare the way of the Lord;
			Make straight in the desert 
			A highway for our God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Every valley shall be exalted,
			And every mountain and hill	shall be made low;
			The crooked places shall be made straight,
			And the rough places smooth;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
			And all flesh shall see it together;
			For the mouth of the Lord has spoken."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Zion,
			You who bring good tidings,
			Get up into the high mountain;
			O Jerusalem,
			You who bring good tidings,
			Lift up your voice with strength,
			Lift it up, be not afraid;
			Say to the cities of Judah,
			"Behold your God!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Behold, the Lord God shall come
			with a strong hand,	
			And His arm shall rule for Him;
			Behold, His reward is with Him,
			And His work before Him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He will feed I lis flock like a shepherd;
			He will gather the lambs with His arm,
			And carry them in His bosom,
			And gently lead those who are with young.
		</verse>
