		<refrain>
			Standing, standing, Standing on the promises
			of God my Savior; Standing,standing,
			I'm standing on the promises of God.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
			Thru eternal ages let His praises ring;
			Glory in the highest I will shout and sing,
			Standing on the promises of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
			When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
			By the living word of God I shall prevail,
			Standing on the promises of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
			Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord,
			Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
			Standing on the promises of God.
		</verse>
