	<eTitle>HAVE MERCY ON ME, O GOD -- Psalm 51, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Have mercy on me, 0 God,
			according to your unfailing love;
			according to your great compassion
			blot out my transgressions.
			Wash away an my iniquity
			and cleanse me from my sin.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For I know my transgressions,
			and my sin is always before me.
			Against you, you only, have I sinned
			and done what is evil in your sight,
			so that you are proved right when you speak
			and justified when you judge.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Surely I have been a sinner from birth,
			sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
			Surely you desire truth in the inner parts;
			you teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;
			wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let me hear joy and gladness;
			let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
			Hide your face from my sins
			and blot out all my iniquity.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Create in me a pure heart, 0 God,
			and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
			Do not cast me from your presence
			or take your Holy Spirit from me.
			Restore to me the joy of your salvation
			and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
			and sinners will turn back to you.
			Save me from blood guilt, 
			0 God, the God who saves me;
			and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Lord, open my lips,
			and my mouth will declare your praise.
			You do not delight in sacrifice
			or I would bring it;
			you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
			a broken and contrite heart, 
			O God, you will not despise.
		</verse>
