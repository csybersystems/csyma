	<verses>
		<verse>
			How lovely is Thy dwelling place,
			O Lord of hosts to me!
			The tabenacles of Thy grace
			How pleasant, Lord, they be!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My thirsty soul longs ardently,
			Yea, faints Thy courts to see;
			My very heart and flesh cry out,
			O living God, for Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Behold the sparrow findeth out
			A house where-in to rest;
			The swallow also, for herself
			Provided hath a nest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Ev'n Thine own altars, where she safe
			Her young ones forth may bring,
			O Thou, almighty Lord of hosts,
			Who art my God and King.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Blest are they in Thy house that dwell,
			They ever give Thee praise.
			Blest is the man whose strength Thou art,
			In whose heart are Thy ways.
		</verse>
