	<verses>
		<verse>
			"Lord God, you are great, and we honor you.
			You are faithful to your covenant and show constant love
			to those who love you and do what you command.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"We have sinned, we have been evil, we have done wrong.
			We have rejected what you commanded us to do
			and have turned away from what you showed us was right.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"We have not listened to your servants the prophets,
			who spoke in your name to our kings, our rulers,
			our ancestors, and our whole nation.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"You, Lord, always do what is right,
			but we have always brought dis grace on ourselves....
			You are merciful and forgiving,
			although we have rebelled against you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"We did not listen to you, 0 Lord our God,
			when you told us to live according to the laws
			which you gave us through your servants the prophets....
			You did what you said you would do to us and our rulers....
			O Lord our God, we have not tried to please you
			by turning from our sins or by following your truth."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"0 Lord our God, you showed your power
			by bringing your people out of Egypt,
			and your power is still remembered.
			We have sinned; we have done wrong."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Listen to us, 0 God; look at us and see
			the trouble we are in and the suffering
			of the city that bears your name.
			We are praying to you because you are merciful,
			not because we have done right.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Lord, hear us. Lord, forgive us.
			Lord, listen to us, and act!
			In order that everyone will know that you are God,
			do not delay! This city and these people are yours."
