	<verses>
		<verse>
			Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,
			When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;
			Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,
			Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,
			The solemn hush of nature newly born;
			Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,
			In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Still, still with Thee! As to each newborn morning
			A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,
			So does this blessed consciousness, awaking,
			Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So shall it be at last, in that bright morning,
			When the soul waketh and life's shadows flee;
			O in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,
			Shall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee.
		</verse>
