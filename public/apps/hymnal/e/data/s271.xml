	<verses>
		<verse>
			Break Thou the bread of life, Dear Lord, to me,
			As Thou didst break the loaves beside the sea;
			Beyond the sacred page I seek Thee, Lord;
			My spirit pants for Thee, O living Word.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, To me, to me,
			As Thou didst bless the bread by Galilee;
			Then shall all bondage cease, All fetters fall;
			And I shall find my peace, My all in all.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou art the bread of life, O Lord, to me;
			Thy holy Word the truth That saveth me;
			Give me to eat and live With Thee above;
			Teach me to love Thy truth, For Thou art love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Spirit and life are they, Words Thou dost speak;
			I hasten to obey, But I am weak;
			Thou art my only help, Thou art my life;
			Heeding Thy holy Word I win the strife.
		</verse>
