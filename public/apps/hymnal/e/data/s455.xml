		<verse>
			Immortal Love, forever full,
			Forever flowing free,
			Forever shared, forever whole,
			A never ebbing sea!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We nay not climb the heavenly steeps
			To bring the Lord Christ down;
			In vain we search the lowest deeps,
			For him no depths can drown.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But warm, so tender, even yet
			A present help is He;
			And  faith has still its Olivet,
			And love its Galilee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The healing of His seamless dress
			Is by our beds of pain;
			We touch Him in life's throng and press,
			And we are whole again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Through Him the first fond prayers are said,
			Our lips of childhood frame;
			The last low whispers of our dead
			Are burdened with His name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Lord and Master of us all:
			Whate'er our names or sign,
			We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,
			We test our lives by Thine!
		</verse>
