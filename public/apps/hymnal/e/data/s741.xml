	<eTitle>THE SHEPHERD CARES FOR HIS PEOPLE -- Ezekiel 34, NEB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			These are the words of the Lord God:
			Now I myself will ask after my sheep
			and go in search of them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As a shepherd goes in search of his sheep
			when his Hock is dispersed all around him,
			so I will go in search of my sheep and rescue them,
			no matter where they were scattered
			in dark and cloudy days.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will bring them out from every nation,
			gather them in from other lands,
			and lead them home to their own soil.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will graze them on the mountains of Israel,
			by her streams and in all her green fields.
			I will feed them on good grazing-ground,
			and their pasture shall be the high
			mountains of Israel.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There they will rest, there in good pasture,
			and find rich grazing on the mountains of Israel.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I myself will tend my flock,
			I myself pen them in their fold,
			says the Lord God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will search for the lost, recover the straggler,
			bandage the hurt, strengthen the sick,
			leave the healthy and strong to play,
			and give them their proper food.
		</verse>
