	<verses>
		<verse>
			More love to thee, O Christ, more love to thee!
			Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.
			This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to thee;
			more love to thee, more love to thee!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;
			now thee alone I seek, give what is best.
			This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;
			more love to thee, more love to thee!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let sorrow do its work, send grief or pain;
			sweet are thy messengers, sweet their refrain,
			when they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to thee;
			more love to thee, more love to thee!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then shall my latest breath whisper thy praise;
			this be the parting cry my heart shall raise;
			this still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;
			more love to thee, more love to thee!
		</verse>
