			Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,
			Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			O Christian, awake! 'tis the Master's command;
			With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,
			To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,
			Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The cause of thy Master with vigor defend;
			Be watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end;
			Wherever He leads thee, go, valiantly go,
			Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Press on, never doubting, thy Captain is near,
			With grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer;
			His love, like a stream in the desert will flow;
			Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
		</verse>
