		<verse>
			O Lord, now let Your servant
			Depart in heav'nly peace,
			For I have seen the glory
			Of Your redeeming grace:
			A light to lead the Gentiles
			Unto Your holy hill,
			The glory of Your people,
			Your chosen Israel.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then grant that I may follow Your gleam,
			O glorious Light,
			Till earthly shadows scatter,
			And faith is changed to sight;
			Till raptured saints shall gather
			Upon that shining shore,
			Where Christ, the blessed Day star,
			Shall light them evermore.
		</verse>
