	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, guide our way to eternal day:
			So shall we, no more delaying,
			Follow Thee, Thy voice obeying:
			Lead us by the hand to our Father's land.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When we danger meet steadfast make our feet;
			Lord, preserve us uncomplaining
			Mid the darkness round us reigning:
			Through adversity lies our way to Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Order all our way through the mortal day:
			In our toil, with aid be near us:
			In our need, with succour cheer us:
			Till we safely stand in our Father's land.
		</verse>
