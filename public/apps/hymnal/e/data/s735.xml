	<eTitle>THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS -- Matthew 28, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			After the Sabbath, at dawn on the
			first day of the week,
			Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
			went to look at the tomb.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There was a violent earthquake, 
			for an angel of the Lord came down
			from heaven and, going to the tomb,
			rolled back the stone and sat on it.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His appearance was like lightning, 
			and his clothes were white as snow.
			The guards were so afraid of him that they 
			shook and became like dead men.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid,
			for I know that you are looking for Jesus,
			who was crucified.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said....
			Go quickly and tell his disciples: 
			'He has risen from the dead.'"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So the women hurried away from the tomb,
			afraid yet filled with joy,
			and ran to tell his disciples.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.*
