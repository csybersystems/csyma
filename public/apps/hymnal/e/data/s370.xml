	<verses>
		<verse>
			Christ for the world we sing,
			the world to Christ we bring,
			with loving zeal;
			the poor, and them that mourn,
			the faint and overborne,
			sinsick and sorrow-worn,
			whom Christ doth heal.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Christ for the world we sing,
			the world to Christ we bring,
			with fervent prayer;
			the wayward and the lost,
			by restless passions tossed,
			redeemed at countless cost,
			from dark despair.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Christ for the world we sing,
			the world to Christ we bring,
			with joyful song;
			the newborn souls, whose days,
			reclaimed from error's ways,
			inspired with hope and praise,
			to Christ belong.
