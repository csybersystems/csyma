		<verse>
			Don't forget the Sabbath,
			The Lord our God hath blest,
			Of all the week the brightest,
			Of all the week the best;
			It brings repose from labor,
			It tells of joy divine,
			Its beams of light descending,
			With heavenly beauty shine.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
			Blessed Sabbath day,
			Welcome, welcome, ever welcome,
			Blessed Sabbath day.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Keep the Sabbath holy,
			And worship Him today,
			Who said to His disciples,
			"I am the living way;"
			And if we meekly follow
			Our Savior here below,
			He'll give us of the fountain
			Whose streams eternal flow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Day of sacred pleasure!
			Its golden hours we'll spend
			In thankful hymns to Jesus,
			The children's dearest Friend;
			O gentle loving, Savior,
			How good and kind Thou art,
			How precious is Thy promise
			To dwell in every heart!
		</verse>
