		<verse>
			I hear Thy welcome voice,
			That calls me, Lord, to Thee;
			For cleansing in Thy precious blood,
			That flowed on Calvary.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			I am coming, Lord!
			Coming now to Thee!
			Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
			That flowed on Calvary.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Though coming weak and vile,
			Thou dost my strength assure;
			Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
			Till spotless all, and pure.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			'Tis Jesus calls me on
			To perfect faith and love,
			To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
			For earth and heaven above.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All hail, atoning blood!
			All hail, redeeming grace!
			All hail! the gift of Christ, our Lord,
			Our Strength and Righteousness.
		</verse>
