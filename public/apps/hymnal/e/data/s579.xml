	<verses>
		<refrain>
			God is love; we're his little children.
			God is love; we would be like Him.
			'Tis love that makes us happy,
			'Tis love that smooths the way;
			It helps us "mind," it makes us kind
			To others every day.
		</refrain>

			'Tis love that makes us happy,
			'Tis love that smooths the way;
			It helps us mind, it makes us kind
			To others every day.

		<verse>
			This world is full of sorrow,
			Of sickness, death, and sin;
			With loving heart we'll do our part,
			And try some soul to win.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And when this life is over,
			And we are called above
			Our song shall be, eternally,
			Of Jesus and His love.
		</verse>
