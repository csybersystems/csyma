	<eTitle>ASSURANCE OF ETERNAL LIFE -- John 3, 10, and 1 John 5, Jerusalem.</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			"Yes, God loved the world so much
			that he gave his only Son,
			so that everyone who believes in him
			may not be lost but may have eternal life.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"For God sent his Son into the world
			not to condemn the world,
			but so that through him
			the world might be saved."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The sheep that belong to me listen to my voice;
			I know them and they follow me.
			I give them eternal life;
			they will never be lost
			and no one will steal them from me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The Father who gave them to me
			is greater than anyone,
			and no one can steal from the Father.
			The Father and I are one."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This is the testimony:
			God has given us eternal life
			and this life is in his Son;
			anyone who has the Son has life,
			anyone who does not have the Son
			does not have life.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I have written all this to you so that you
			who believe in the name of the Son of God
			may be sure that you have eternal life.
