	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, stand among us
			In Thy risen power;
			Let this time of worship
			Be a hallowed hour.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Breathe the Holy Spirit
			Into every heart;
			Bid the fears and sorrows
			From each soul depart.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thus with quickened footsteps
			We pursue our way,
			Watching for the dawning
			Of eternal day.
		</verse>
