			Let shouts of holy joy outburst. Alleluia!

			The three sad days have quickly sped,
			He rises glorious from the dead.
			All glory to our risen head! Alleluia!

			Lord, by the stripes which wounded You,
			From death's sting free Your servants too,
			That we may live and sing to You. Alleluia!
