		<verse>
			Now praise the hidden God of love 
			In whom we all must live and move,
			Who shepherds us, at every stage
			Thro' youth, maturity, and age.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who challenged us, when were young
			To storm the citadels of wrong;
			In care for others taught us how
			God's true community must grow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who bids us never lose our zest,
			Tho' age is urging us to rest,
			But proves to us that we have still 
			A work to do, a place to fill.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then talk no more of wasted time,
			But Godward look, and upward climb,
			Content to sleep, when day is done,
			And rise refreshed, and travel on.
		</verse>
