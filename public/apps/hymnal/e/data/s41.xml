	<verses>
		<verse>
			O splendor of God's glory bright,
			From light eternal bringing light;
			O Light of life, light's living spring,
			True day, all days illumining.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Thou true Sun, on us Thy glance
			Let fall in royal radiance;
			The Spirit's sanctifying beam
			Upon our earthly senses stream.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O joyful be the passing day
			With thoughts as clear as morning's ray,
			With faith like noontide shining bright,
			Our souls unshadowed by the night.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Dawn's glory gilds the earth and skies;
			Let Him, our perfect morn, arise;
			The Father's help His children claim,
			And sing the Father's glorious name. Amen.
		</verse>
