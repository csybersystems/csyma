	<verses>
		<verse>
			Every star shall sing a carol;
			Every creatures, high or low,
			Come and praise the King of heaven
			By whatever name you know.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			God above, Man below,
			Holy is the name I know.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			When the King of all creation
			Had a cradle on the earth,
			Holy was the human body,
			Holy was the human birth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Every star and every planet,
			Every creature, high or low,
			Come and praise the King of heaven
			By whatever name you know.
		</verse>
