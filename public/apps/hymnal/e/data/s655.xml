		<verse>
			Happy the home when God is there,
			and love fills every breast;
			when one their wish, and one their prayer,
			and one their heavenly rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Happy the home where Jesus' name
			is sweet to every ear;
			where children early speak his fame,
			and parents hold him dear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Happy the home where prayer is heard,
			and praise is wont to rise;
			where parents love the sacred Word
			and all its wisdom prize.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, let us in our homes agree
			this blessed peace to gain;
			unite our hearts in love to thee,
			and love to all will reign.
