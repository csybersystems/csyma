	<eTitle>PRAISE THE LORD, YOU THAT ARE HIS SERVANTS -- Psalms 113 and 114, NEB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			O praise the Lord.
			Praise the Lord, you that are his servants,
			praise the name of the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Blessed be the name of the Lord now and evermore.
			From the rising of the sun to its setting
			may the Lord's name be praised.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			High is the Lord above all nations,
			his glory above the heavens.
			There is none like the Lord our God
			in heaven or on earth,
			who sets his throne so high
			but deigns to look down so low;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			who lifts the weak out of the dust 
			and raises the poor from the dunghill,
			giving them a place among princes,
			among the princes of his people;
			who makes the woman in a childless
			house a happy mother of children.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O praise the Lord.
