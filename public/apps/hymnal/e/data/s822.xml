	<verses>
		<verse>
			The Lord God took the man
			and put him in the Garden of Eden
			to work it and take care of it.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Six days you shall labor and do all your work.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"By the sweat of your brow
			you will eat your food."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The sleep of a laborer is sweet,
			whether he eats little or much.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Whatever your hand finds to do,
			do it with all your might.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We gave you this rule:
			"If a man will not work,
			he shall not eat."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If anyone does not provide for his relatives,
			and especially for his immediate family,
			he has denied the faith and
			is worse than an unbeliever.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Never be lacking in zeal,
			but keep your spiritual fervor,
			serving the Lord.
		</verse>
