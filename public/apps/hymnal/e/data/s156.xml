	<eTitle>O Sacred Head Now Wounded</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			O sacred Head, now wounded,
			with grief and shame weighed down,
			now scornfully surounded
			with thorns, thine only crown:
			O sacred head what glory, 
			what bliss til now was thine
			Yet though despised and gory
			I joy to call thee mine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What thou, my Lord, has suffered
			was all for sinners' gain;
			mine, mine was the transgression,
			but thine the deadly pain.
			Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
			'Tis I deserve thy place;
			look on me with thy favor,
			vouch safe to me thy grace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What language shall I borrow
			to thank thee, dearest friend,
			for this thy dying sorrow,
			thy pity without end?
			O make me thine forever;
			and should I fainting be,
			Lord, let me never, never
			outlive my love to Thee.
