		<verse>
			All praise to thee, my God, this night,
			for all the blessings of the light!
			Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
			beneath thine own almighty wings.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son,
			the ill that I this day have done,
			that with the world, myself, and thee,
			I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O may my soul on thee repose,
			and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close,
			sleep that may me more vigorous make
			to serve my God when I awake.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
			praise him, all creatures here below;
			praise him above, ye heavenly host;
			praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
		</verse>
