	<verses>
		<verse>
			I'm but a stranger here, heaven is my home;
			Earth is desert drear, heaven is my home;
			Danger and sorrow stand round me on every hand;
			Heaven is my Fatherland, heaven is my home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What though the tempest rage, heaven is my home;
			Short is my pilgrimage, heaven is my home.
			Time's cold and wintry blast soon will be over past;
			I shall reach home at last; heaven is my home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There at my Savior's side, heaven is my home;
			I shall be glorified, heaven is my home.
			There'll be the good and blest, those I love most and best,
			There,  too, I soon shall rest; heaven is my home.
		</verse>
