	<verses>
		<verse>
			Come, you faithful, raise the strain
			Of triumphant gladness;
			God has brought His people forth
			Into joy from sadness.
			Now rejoice, Jerusalem, 
			And with true affection
			Welcome in unwearied strains 
			Jesus' resurrection.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			'Tis the spring of souls today;
			Christ has burst His prison
			From the frost and gloom of death
			light and life have risen
			All the winter of our sins,
			Long and dark, is flying
			From His ligth, to whom we give
			Thanks and praise undying.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Alleluia!" now we cry
			to our King immortal,
			Who, triumphant, burst the
			bars of the tomb's dark portal
			"Alleluia!" with the Son,
			God the Father praising;
			"Alleluia!" yet again to
			the Spirit raising.
		</verse>
