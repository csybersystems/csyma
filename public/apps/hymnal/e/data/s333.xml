	<verses>
		<verse>
			On Jordan's banks the Baptist's cry
			Announces that the Lord is nigh;
			Awake and hearken, for he brings
			Glad tidings of the King of kings!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then cleansed be every life from sin;
			Make straight the way for God within,
			And let us all our hearts prepare
			For Christ to come and enter there.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We hail You as our Savior, Lord,
			Our refuge and our great reward;
			Without Your grace we waste away
			Like flow'rs that wither and decay.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Stretch forth Your hand, our health restore,
			And make us rise to fall no more;
			Oh, let Your face upon us shine
			And fill the world with love divine.
		</verse>
