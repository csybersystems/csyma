	<verses>
		<verse>
			O love of God, how strong and true!
			Eternal, and yet ever new;
			Uncomprehended and unbought,
			Beyond all knowledge and all thought.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O love of God, how deep and great,
			Far deeper than man's deepest hate;
			Selffed, selfkindled like the light,
			Changeless, eternal, infinite.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We read thee best in Him who came
			To bear for us the cross of shame;
			Sent by the Father from on high,
			Our life to live, our death to die.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We read thy power to bless and save,
			E'en in the darkness of the grave;
			Still more in resurrection light
			We read the fullness of thy might.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O love of God, our shield and stay
			Through all the perils of our way!
			Eternal love, in thee we rest,
			Forever safe, forever blest.
		</verse>
