	<verses>
		<verse>
			Be not dismayed whate'er betide,
			God will take care of you;
			Beneath His wings of love abide,
			God will take care of you.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			God will take care of you
			Through every day, o'er all the way;
			He will take care of you,
			God will take care of you.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Through days of toil when your heart doth fail,
			God will take care of you;
			When dangers fierce your path assail,
			God will take care of you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All you may need He will provide,
			God will take care of you;
			Nothing you ask will be denied,
			God will take care of you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			No matter what may be the test,
			God will take care of you;
			Lean, weary one, upon his breast,
			God will take care of you.
		</verse>
