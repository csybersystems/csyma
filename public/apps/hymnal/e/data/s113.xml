		<verse>
			As pants the hart for cooling streams
			When heated in the chase,
			So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,
			And Thy refreshing grace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For Thee, my God, the living God,
			My thirsty soul doth pine:
			O when shall I behold Thy face,
			Thou Majesty divine?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
			Hope still, and thou shalt sing
			The praise of Him who is thy God,
			Thy health's eternal spring.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
			The God whom we adore,
			Be glory, as it was, is now,
			And shall be evermore.
		</verse>
