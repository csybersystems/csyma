		<verse>
			O for a thousand tongues to sing
			my great Redeemer's praise,
			the glories of my God and King,
			the triumphs of his grace!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My gracious Master and my God,
			assist me to proclaim,
			to spread through all the earth abroad
			the honors of thy name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
			that bids our sorrows cease;
			'tis music in the sinner's ears,
			'tis life, and health, and peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He breaks the power of canceled sin,
			he sets the prisoner free;
			his blood can make the foulest clean;
			his blood availed for me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He speaks, and listening to his voice,
			new life the dead receive;
			the mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
			the humble poor believe.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
			your loosened tongues employ;
			ye blind, behold your savior come,
			and leap, ye lame, for joy.
		</verse>
