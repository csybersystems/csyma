	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, Friend of little children, Be a friend to me;
			Take my hand and ever keep me close to Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Teach me how to grow in goodness, Daily as I grow;
			Thou hast been a child, and surely Thou dost know.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Step by step, O, lead me onward, Upward into youth;
			Wiser, stronger, still becoming in Thy truth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Never leave me, nor forsake me, ever be my Friend;
			For I need Thee from life's dawning to its end.
		</verse>
