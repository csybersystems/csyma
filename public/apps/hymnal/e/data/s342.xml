	<verses>
		<verse>
			Is this a day of new beginnings,
			Time to remember and move on,
			Time to believe what love is bringing,
			Laying to rest the pain that's gone?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How can the seasons of a planet
			Mindlessly spinning round its sun
			With just a human name and number
			Say that some new thing has begun?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yet thro' the life and death of Jesus
			Love's mighty Spirit, now as then,
			Can make for us a world of difference
			As faith and hope are born again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then let us, with the Spirit's daring,
			Step from the past and leave behind
			Its disappointment, guilt, and grieving,
			Seeking new paths, and sure to find.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Christ is alive, and goes before us
			To show and share what love can do.
			This is a day of new beginnings;
			Our God is making all things new.
		</verse>
