		<verse>
			Holy Spirit, hear us;
			Help us while we sing;
			Breathe into the music
			Of the praise we bring.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy Spirit, prompt us
			When we kneel to pray;
			Nearer come, and teach us
			What we ought to say.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy Spirit, shine Thou
			On the Book we read;
			Gild its holy pages
			With the light we need.
