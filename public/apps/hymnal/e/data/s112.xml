		<verse>
			Let us with a gladsome mind
			Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
			For His mercies shall endure,
			Ever faithful, ever sure.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He, with all commanding might,
			Filled the new made world with light:
			For His mercies shall endure,
			Ever faithful, ever sure.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All things living He does feed;
			His full hand supplies their need:
			For His mercies shall endure,
			Ever faithful, ever sure.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let us then with gladsome mind
			Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
			For His mercies shall endure,
			Ever faithful, ever sure.
