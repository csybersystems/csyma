	<eTitle>RECONCILIATION -- 2 Corinthians 5, TEV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			We are ruled by the love of Christ,
			now that we recognize that one man died for everyone,
			which means that they all share in his death.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He died for all, so that those who live
			should no longer live for themselves,
			but only for him who died and was
			raised to life for their sake.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			No longer, then, do we judge anyone
			by human standards.	
			Even if at one time we judged Christ
			according to human standards,
			we no longer do so.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When anyone is joined to Christ,
			he is a new being; the old is gone,
			the new has come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All this is done by God,
			who through Christ changed us
			from enemies into his friends and gave
			us the task of making others his friends also.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Our message is that God was making
			all mankind his friends through Christ.
			God did not keep an account of their sins,
			and he has given us the message which tells
			how he makes them his friends.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Here we are, then, speaking for Christ,
			as though God himself were making
			his appeal through us.
			We plead on Christ's behalf:
			let God change you from enemies into his friends!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Christ was without sin,
			but for our sake God made him share
			our sin in order that in union with him
			we might share the righteousness of God.
		</verse>
