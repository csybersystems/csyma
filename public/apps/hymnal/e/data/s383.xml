	<verses>
		<verse>
			O day of rest and gladness,
			O day of joy and light,
			O balm of care and sadness,
			Most beautiful, most bright;
			On thee, the high and lowly,
			Who bend before the throne,
			Sing, Holy, holy, holy,
			To the Eternal One.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou art a port protected
			From storms that round us rise,
			A garden intersected
			With streams of Paradise;
			Thou art a cooling fountain
			In life's dry, dreary sand;
			From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,
			We view our promised land.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A day of sweet reflection
			Thou art, a day of love;
			A day to raise affection
			From earth to things above.
			New graces ever gaining
			From this our day of rest
			We seek the rest remaining
			In mansions of the blest.
		</verse>
