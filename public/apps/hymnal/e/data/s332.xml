	<verses>
		<verse>
			O now I see the crimson wave,
			The fountain deep and wide;
			Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
			Points to His wounded side.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			The cleansing stream I see, I see,
			I plunge, and O, it cleanseth me!
			O praise the Lord! it cleanseth me,
			It cleanseth me, yes,cleanseth me.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I see the new creation rise,
			I hear the speaking blood;
			It speaks-polluted nature dies,
			Sinks' neath the cleansing flood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I rise to walk in heaven's own light,
			Above the world and sin;
			With heart made pure and garments white,
			And Christ enthroned within.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Amazing grace! 'tis heaven below
			To feel the blood applied,
			And Jesus, only Jesus, know,
			My Jesus crucified.
		</verse>
