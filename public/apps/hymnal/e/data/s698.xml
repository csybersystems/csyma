	<eTitle>HOW LOVELY IS THY DWELLING PLACE  -- Psalm 84, RSV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			How lovely is thy dwelling place,
			O Lord of hosts!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My soul longs, yea, faints 
			for the courts of the Lord; 
			my heart and flesh sing for joy 
			to the living God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Even the sparrow finds a home, 
			and the swallow a nest for herself, 
			where she may lay her young,
			at thy altars, 0 Lord of hosts, 
			my King and my God.
			Blessed are those who dwell in thy house,
			ever singing thy praise!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For a day in thy courts is better 
			than a thousand elsewhere.
			I would rather be a doorkeeper 
			in the house of my God
			than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the Lord God is a sun and shield; 
			he bestows favor and honor.
			No good thing does the Lord withhold
			from those who walk uprightly.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Lord of hosts,
			blessed is the man who trusts in thee!
		</verse>
