	<verses>
		<verse>
			O Lord my God! when I in awesome wonder
			Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,
			I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
			Thy pow'r thro'out the universe displayed,
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee;
			How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
			Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee;
			How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			When thro'the woods and forest glades I wander
			And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
			When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
			And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
			Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
			That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
			He bled and died to take away my sin;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
			And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
			Then I shall bow in humble adoration
			And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!
		</verse>
