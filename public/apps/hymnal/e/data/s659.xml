		<verse>
			May the grace of Christ our Savior
			And the Father's boundless love,
			With the Holy Spirit's favor,
			Rest upon them from above.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thus may they abide in union
			With each other and the Lord,
			And possess, in sweet communion,
			Joys which earth cannot afford.
