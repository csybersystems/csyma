		<verse>
			Come, every soul by sin oppressed,
			There's mercy with the Lord,
			And He will surely give you rest,
			By trusting in His word.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Only trust Him, only trust Him,
					 Only trust Him now;
					 He will save you, He will save you,
					 He will save you now.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			For Jesus shed His precious blood
			Rich blessings to bestow;
			Plunge now into the crimson flood
			That washes white as snow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way,
			That leads you into rest;
			Believe in Him without delay,
			And you are fully blest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, then, and join this holy band,
			And on to glory go,
			To dwell in that celestial land,
			Where joys immortal flow.
		</verse>
