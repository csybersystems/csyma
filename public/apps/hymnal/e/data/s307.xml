	<verses>
		<verse>
			I am coming to the cross;
			I am poor, and weak, and blind;
			I am counting all but dross;
			I shall full salvation find.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
			O Thou Lamb of Calvary;
			Humbly at Thy cross I bow;
			Save me, Jesus, save me now.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Long my heart has sighed for Thee;
			Long has evil reigned within;
			Jesus sweetly speaks to me,
			"I will cleanse you all sin."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Here I give my all to Thee-
			Friends, and time, and earthly store;
			Soul and body Thine to be,
			Wholly Thine forevermore.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus comes! He fills my soul!
			Perfected in Him I am;
			I am every whit made whole-
			Glory, glory to the Lamb!
		</verse>
