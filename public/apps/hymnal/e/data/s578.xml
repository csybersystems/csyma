	<verses>
		<verse>
			So send I you-by grace made strong to triumph
			O'er hosts of hell, o'er darkness, death, and sin,
			My name to bear, and in that name to conquer-
			So send I you, my victory to win.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So send I you-to take to souls in bondage
			The word of truth that sets the captive free,
			To break the bonds of sin, to lost death's fetters-
			So send I you, to bring the lost to me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So send I you-my strength to know in weakness,
			My joy in grief, my perfect peace in pain,
			To prove My power, My grace, My promised presence-
			So send I you, eternal fruit to gain.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So send I you-to bear My cross with patience,
			And then one day with joy to lay it down,
			To hear My voice, "well done, My faithful servant-
			Come, share My throne, My kingdom, and My crown!"
			"As the Father hath sent Me, so send I you."
		</verse>
