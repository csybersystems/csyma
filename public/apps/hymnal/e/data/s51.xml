	<verses>
		<verse>
			Day is dying in the west;
			Heaven is touching earth with rest;
			Wait and worship while the night
			Sets the evening lamps alight
			Through all the sky.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!
			Heaven and earth are full of Thee!
			Heaven and earth are praising Thee,
			O Lord most high!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Lord of life, beneath the dome
			Of the universe, Thy home,
			Gather us who seek Thy face
			To the fold of Thy embrace,
			For Thou art nigh.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			While the deepening shadows fall,
			Heart of love enfolding all,
			Through the glory and the grace
			Of the stars that veil Thy face,
			Our hearts ascend.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When forever from our sight
			Pass the stars, the day, the night,
			Lord of angels, on our eyes
			Let eternal morning rise
			And shadows end.
		</verse>
