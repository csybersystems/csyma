	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord, I have made Thy word my choice,
			My lasting heritage;
			There shall my noblest pow'rs rejoice,
			My warmest thoughts engage.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I'll read the histories of Thy love,
			And keep Thy laws in sight;
			While through Thy promises I rove,
			With ever fresh delight.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In this broad land of wealth unknown,
			Where springs of life arise,
			Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,
			And hidden glory lies.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The best relief that mourners have,
			It makes our sorrows blest;
			Our fairest hope beyond the grave,
			And our eternal rest.
		</verse>
