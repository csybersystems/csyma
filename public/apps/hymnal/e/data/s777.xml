	<eTitle>CHRISTIAN UNITY -- Ephesians 4, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			As a prisoner for the Lord, then,
			I urge you to live a life worthy of
			the calling you have received.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be completely humble and gentle; be patient,
			bearing with one another in love.
			Make every effort to keep the unity of
			the Spirit through the bond of peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There is one body and one Spirit—
			just as you were called to one hope
			when you were called—
			one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
			one God and Father of all,
			who is over all and through all and in all.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But to each one of us grace has been
			given as Christ apportioned it.
			This is why it says:
			"When he ascended on high,
			he led captives in his train
			and gave gifts to men."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It was he who gave some to be apostles,
			some to be prophets, some to be evangelists,
			and some to be pastors and teachers,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To prepare God's people
			for works of service,
			so that the body of Christ may
			be built up until we all reach unity
			in the faith and in the knowledge of the
			Son of God and become mature,
			attaining to the whole measure
			of the fullness of Christ.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then we will no longer be infants,
			tossed back and forth by the waves,
			and blown here and there
			by every wind of teaching and by
			the cunning and craftiness of
			men in their deceitful scheming.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Instead, speaking the truth in love,
			we will in all things grow up into
			him who is the Head, that is, Christ.
			From him the whole body,
			joined and held together
			by every supporting ligament,
			grows and builds itself up in love,
			as each part does its work.
		</verse>
