	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Just when I need Him most,
			Just when I need Him most;
			Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,
			Just when I need Him most.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Just when I need Him, Jesus is near,
			Just when I falter, just when I fear;
			Ready to help me, ready to cheer,
			Just when I need him most.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just when I need Him, Jesus is true,
			Never forsaking all the way thro';
			Giving for burdens pleasures anew,
			Just when I need him most.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just when I need Him, Jesus is strong,
			Bearing my burdens all the day long;
			For all my sorrow giving a song,
			Just when I need Him most;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just when I need Him, He is my all.
			Answering when upon Him I call:
			Tenderly watching lest I should fall,
			Just when I need Him most;
		</verse>
