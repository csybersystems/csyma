		<verse>
			Awake, my soul! Stretch every nerve,
			And press with vigor on;
			A heavenly race demands thy zeal,
			And an immortal crown.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			'Tis God's all animating voice
			That calls thee from on high;
			'Tis He whose hand presents the prize
			To thine aspiring eye.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A cloud of witnesses around
			Hold thee in full survey;
			Forget the steps already trod,
			And onward urge thy way.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Blest Savior, introduced by Thee,
			Our race have we begun;
			And, crowned with victory, at Thy feet
			We'll lay our trophies down.
		</verse>
