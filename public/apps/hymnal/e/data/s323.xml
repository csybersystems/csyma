		<verse>
			O for a heart to praise my God!
			A heart from sin set free,
			A heart that always feels Thy blood,
			So freely shed for me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
			My dear Redeemer's throne,
			Where only Christ is heard to speak,
			Where Jesus reigns alone.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A heart in every thought renewed,
			And full of love divine,
			Perfect, and right, and pure, and good,
			A copy, Lord, of Thine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
			Come quickly from above;
			Write Thy new name upon my heart,
			Thy new, best name of Love.
		</verse>
