	<verses>
		<verse>
			Heavenly Father, bless us now;
			At the cross of Christ we bow;
			Take our guilt and grief away;
			Hear and heal us now, we pray.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now, O Lord, this very hour,
			Send Thy grace and show Thy power;
			While we rest upon Thy word,
			Come, and bless us now, O Lord!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Mercy now, O Lord, we plead
			In this hour of utter need;
			Turn us not away unblest;
			Calm our anguish into rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Thou loving, blessed One,
			Rising o√©r us like the sun,
			Light and life art Thou within:
			Savior, Thou, from every sin!
		</verse>
