			"I will sing to the Lord,
			For He has triumphed gloriously!
			The horse and its rider He has
			thrown into the sea!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The Lord is my strength and song,
			And He has become my salvation;
			He is my God, and I will praise Him;
			My Father's God, and I will exalt Him.
		</verse>

			"The Lord is a man of war;
			The Lord is His name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Pharaoh's chariots and his army
			He has cast into the sea;
			His chosen captains also
			are drowned in the Red Sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The depths have covered them;
			They sank to the bottom like a stone.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Your right hand, 0 Lord,
			has become glorious in power;
			Your right hand, 0 Lord,
			has dashed the enemy in pieces.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"And in the greatness of Your excellence
			You have overthrown those who rose against You;
			You sent forth Your wrath
			which consumed them like stubble.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"And with the blast of Your nostrils
			The waters were gathered together;
			The floods stood upright like a heap;
			And the depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The enemy said, 'I will pursue,
			I will overtake,
			I will divide the spoil;
			My desire shall be satisfied on them.
			I will draw my sword,
			My hand shall destroy them.'

			"You blew with Your wind,
			the sea covered them;
			They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
		</verse>

			"Who is like You, 0 Lord, among the gods?
			Who is like You, glorious in holiness,
			Fearful in praises, doing wonders?
		</verse>

			The earth swallowed them.
			You in Your mercy have led forth
			The people whom You have redeemed;
			You have guided them in Your strength
			To Your holy habitation.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The people will hear and be afraid;
			Sorrow will take hold of the inhabitants of Palestina.
			Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed;
			The mighty men of Moab,
			Trembling will take hold of them;
			All the inhabitants of Canaan will melt away.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Fear and dread will fall on them;
			By the greatness of Your arm
			They will be as still as a stone,
			Till Your people pass over, 0 Lord,
			Till the people pass over
			Whom You have purchased.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"You will bring them in and plant them
			In the mountain of Your inheritance,
			In the place, 0 Lord, which You have made
			For Your own dwelling,
			The sanctuary, 0 Lord,
			which You hands have established.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The Lord shall reign forever and ever."
