	<verses>
		<verse>
			Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
			and all the world go free?
			No, there's a cross for everyone,
			and there's a cross for me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The consecrated cross I'll bear
			till He shall set me free;
			and then go home my crown to wear,
			for there's a crown for me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Upon the crystal pavement, down
			at Jesus' pierced feet,
			with joy I'll cast my golden crown,
			and His dear name repeat.
		</verse>
