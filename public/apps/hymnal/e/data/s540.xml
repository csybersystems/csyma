		<verse>
			Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
			Look upon a little child;
			Pity my simplicity,
			Suffer me to come to thee
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lamb of God, I look to Thee;
			Thou shalt my example be;
			Thou art gentle, meek and mild;
			Thou was once a little child
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Fain I would be as thou art;
			Give me Thy obedient heart;
			Thou art pitiful and kind,
			Let me have Thy loving mind
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I shall then show forth thy praise,
			Serve thee all my happy days;
			Then the world shall always see Christ,
			The Holy Child in me.
		</verse>
