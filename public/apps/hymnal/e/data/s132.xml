	<verses>
		<verse>
			O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
			O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!
			Come and behold Him, born the King of angels!
			O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
			O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sing, choirs of angels sing in exultation,
			O sing all ye citizens of heaven above!
			Glory to God, all glory in the highest!
			O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
			O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning,
			Jesus, to Thee be all glory given;
			Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!
			O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
			O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!
