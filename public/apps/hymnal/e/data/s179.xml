	<eTitle>The Wonders of Redeeming Love</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The wonders of redeeming love
			Our highest thoughts exceed;
			The Son of God comes from above
			For sinful man to bleed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He gives Himself, His life, His all,
			A sinless sacrifice.
			For man He drains the cup of gall,
			For man the victim dies.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And now before His Father's face
			His precious blood He pleads;
			For those who seek the throne of grace
			His lovee still intercedes.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He knows the frailties of our frame,
			For He has borne our grief;
			Our great High Priest once felt the same,
			And He can send relief.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His love will not be satisfied,
			Till He in glory sees
			The faithful ones for whom He died
			From sin forever free.
		</verse>
