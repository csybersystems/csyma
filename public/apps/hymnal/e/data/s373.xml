	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Going afar upon the mountain,
			(Going afar upon the mountain,)
			Bringing the wand'rer back again, back again,
			(Bringing the wand'rer back again,)
			Into the fold of my Redeemer,
			(Into the fold of my Redeemer,)
			Jesus, the Lamb for sinners slain, for sinners slain.
			(Jesus, the Lamb for sinners slain.)
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Seeking the lost yes, kindly entreating
			Wanders on the mountain astray;
			"Come unto Me," His message repeating,
			Words of the Master speaking today.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Seeking the lost and pointing to Jesus
			Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,
			Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
			Showing the path to life evermore.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thus I would go on missions of mercy,
			Following Christ from day unto day,
			Cheering the faint and raising the fallen,
			Pointing the lost to Jesus, the Way.
		</verse>
