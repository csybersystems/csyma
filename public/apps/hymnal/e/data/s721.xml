	<eTitle>LORD, YOU HAVE BEEN OUR REFUGE -- Psalm 90, Jerusalem</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord, you have been our refuge age after age.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Before the mountains were born 
			before the earth or the world came to birth,
			you were God from all eternity and for ever.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You can turn man back into dust by saying,
			"Back to what you were, you sons of men!"
			To you, a thousand years are a single day,
			a yesterday now over, an hour of the night.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You brush men away like waking dreams,
			they are like grass sprouting and flowering
			in the morning,
			withered and dry before dusk.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We too are burnt up by your anger
			and terrified by your fury;
			having summoned up our sins
			you inspect our secrets by your own light.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Our days dwindle under your wrath,
			our lives are over in a breath
			--our life lasts for seventy years,
			eighty with good health,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			but they all add up to anxiety and trouble
			over in a trice, and then we are gone.
			Who yet has felt the full force of your fury,
			or learnt to fear the violence of your rage?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Teach us to count how few days we have
			and so gain wisdom of heart.
		</verse>
