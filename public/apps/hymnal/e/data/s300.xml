		<verse>
			Rock of ages, cleft for me,
			Let me hide myself in Thee;
			Let the water and the blood,
			From Thy riven side which flowed
			Be of sin and double cure,
			Cleanse me from its guilt and power
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Not the labors of my hands
			Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
			Could my zeal no respite know,
			Could my tears forever flow,
			All for sin could not atone;
			Thou must save, and Thou a lone.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When my pilgrimage I close,
			Victor o'er the last of foes,
			When I soar to worlds unknown,
			And behold Thee on Thy throne,
			Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
			Let me hide myself in Thee.
		</verse>
