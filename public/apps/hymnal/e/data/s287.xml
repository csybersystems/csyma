		<verse>
			Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
			calling for you and for me;
			see, on the portals he's waiting and watching,
			watching for you and for me.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Come home, come home;
			ye who are weary come home;
			earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
			calling, O sinner, come home!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Why should we tary when Jesus is pleading,
			pleading for you and for me?
			Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,
			mercies for you and for me?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Think of the wonderful love he has promised,
			promised for you and for me!
			Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon,
			pardon for you and for me.
		</verse>
