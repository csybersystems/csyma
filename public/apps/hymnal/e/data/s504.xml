		<verse>
			Lord Jesus, think on me,
			And purge away my sin;
			From earth-born passions set me free,
			And make me pure within.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord Jesus, think on me,
			With care and woe oppresed;
			Let me Thy loving servant be,
			And taste Thy promised rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord Jesus, think on me,
			Nor let me go astray;
			Through darkness and perplexity
			Point Thou the heavenly way.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord Jesus, think on me,
			That I may sing above
			To Father, Spirit and to Thee,
			The strains of praise and love.
