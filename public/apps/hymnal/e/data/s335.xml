		<verse>
			Christ has for sin atonement made,
			What a wonderful Savior!
			We are redeemed! the price is paid!
			What a wonderful Savior!
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Jesus!
			What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Lord!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I praise Him for the cleansing blood,
			What a wonderful Savior!
			That reconciled my soul to God;
			What a wonderful Savior!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He walks beside me all the way,
			What a wonderful Savior!
			And keeps me faithful day by day;
			What a wonderful Savior!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He gives me overcoming power,
			What a wonderful Savior!
			And triumph in each trying hour;
			What a wonderful Savior!
		</verse>
