	<verses>
		<verse>
			We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing;
			He chastens and hastens His will to make known.
			The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.
			Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,
			Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;
			So from the beginning the fight we were winning;
			Thou, Lord, were at our side, all glory be Thine!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We all do extol Thee, Thou leader triumphant,
			And pray that Thou still our defender wilt be.
			Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;
			Thy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!
