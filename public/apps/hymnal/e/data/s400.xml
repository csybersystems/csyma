	<verses>
		<verse>
			I come with joy to meet my Lord,
			Forgiven, loved and free,
			In awe and wonder to recall
			His life laid down for me,
			His life laid down for me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I come with Christians far and near
			To find, as all are fed,
			Our true community of love
			In Christ's communion bread,
			In Christ's communion bread.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As Christ breaks bread for us to share
			Each proud division ends.
			That love that made us makes us one,
			And strangers now are friends,
			And strangers now are friends.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And thus with joy we meet our Lord.
			His presence always near,
			Is in such friendship better known:
			We see and praise Him here,
			We see and praise Him here.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Together met, together bound,
			We'll go our diff'rent ways,
			And as His people in the world,
			We'll live and speak His praise,
			We'll live and speak His praise.
		</verse>
