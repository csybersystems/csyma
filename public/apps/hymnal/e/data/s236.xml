		<verse>
			I love Thee, I love Thee,I love Thee,my Lord;
			I love Thee, my Savior, I love Thee, my God.
			I love Thee, I love Thee, and that Thou dost know;
			But how much I love Thee my actions will show.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I'm happy, I'm happy, O, wondrous account!
			My joys are immortal, I stand on the mount!
			I gaze on my treasure and long to be there,
			With Jesus and angels, and kindred so dear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Jesus, my Savior, with Thee I am blest,
			My life and salvation, my joy and my rest:
			Thy name be my theme, and Thy love be my song;
			Thy grace shall inspire both my heart and my tongue.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O, who's like my Savior? ?He's Salem's bright King;
			He smiles, and He loves me, and helps me to sing.
			I'll praise Him, I'll praise Him, with notes loud and clear
			While rivers of pleasure my spirit do cheer.
