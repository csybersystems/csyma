	<verses>
		<verse>
			Happy the man who discovers wisdom,
			the man who gains discernment:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			gaining her is more rewarding than silver,
			more profitable than gold.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			She is beyond the price of pearls,
			nothing you could covet is her equal.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In her right hand is length of days;
			in her left hand, riches and honour.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In her ways arec delightful ways,
			her paths all lead to contentment.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			She is a tree of life for those who hold her fast,
			those who cling to her live happy lives.
		</verse>
