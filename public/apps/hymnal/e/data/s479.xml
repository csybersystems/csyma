		<refrain>
			Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;
			Tread softly here, tread softly here,
			Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.
			Tread softly here, tread softly here,
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Be silent, be silent,
			A whisper is heard;
			Be silent, and listen,
			Oh treasure each word.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be silent, be silent,
			For holy this place,
			This altar that echoes
			The message of grace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be silent, be silent,
			Breathe humbly our prayer;
			A foretaste of Eden
			This moment we share.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be silent, be silent,
			His mercy record;
			Be silent, be silent,
			And wait on the Lord.
		</verse>
