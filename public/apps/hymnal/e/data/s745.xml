	<eTitle>THE CHRISTIAN'S ASSURANCE -- 1 John 5, Colossians 1, Galatians 4, and Romans 8, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			This is the assurance we have
			in approaching God:
			that if we ask anything according
			to his will, he hears us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For he has rescued us from the dominion
			of darkness and brought us into the kingdom
			of the Son he loves,
			in whom we have redemption,
			the forgiveness of sins.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Because you are sons,
			God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,
			the Spirit, who calls out, "Abba, Father."
			So you are no longer a slave,
			but a son; and since you are a son,
			God has made you also an heir.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What, then, shall we say in response to this?
			If God is for us, who can be against us?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Christ Jesus, who died more than that,
			who was raised to life is at the right hand 
			of God and is also interceding for us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			*Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
			Shall trouble or hardship or persecution 
			or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As it is written:
			"For your sake we face death all day long;
			we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered."
			No, in all these things we are more 
			than conquerors through him who loved us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For I am convinced that neither death nor life,
			neither angels nor demons,
			neither the present nor the future,
			nor any powers, neither height nor depth,
			nor anything else in all creation,
			will be able to separate us
			from the love of God
			that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.*
