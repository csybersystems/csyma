	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Cover with His life, whiter than snow;
			Fullness of His life then shall I know;
			My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
			Cover with His life, whither than snow.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;
			Father, impute His life unto me.
			My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,
			Cover with His life, whiter than snow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Deep are the wounds transgression has made;
			Red are the stains; my soul is afraid.
			O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,
			Safe from the law that now judgeth me!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Longing the joy of pardon to know;
			Jesus holds out a robe white as snow;
			"Lord, I accept it! Leaving my own,
			Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Reconciled by His death for my sin,
			Justified by His life pure and clean,
			Sanctified by obeying His word,
			Glorified when returneth my Lord.
		</verse>
