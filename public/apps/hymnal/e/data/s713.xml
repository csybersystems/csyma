	<eTitle>LOVE OF GOD -- 1 John 4 and John 3, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			In this the love of God was manifested toward us,
			that God has sent His only begotten
			Son into the world,
			that we might live through Him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"For God did not send His Son into the world
			to condemn the world,
			but that the world through Him might be saved."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In this is love, not that we loved God,
			but that He loved us and sent His
			Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God is love,
			and be who abides in love abides in God,
			and God in him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Beloved, if God so loved us,
			we also ought to love one another.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If someone says, "I love God,"
			and bates his brother, be is a liar;
			for be who does not love his brother whom be bas seen,
			bow can be love God whom be bas not seen?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And this commandment we have from Him:
			that he who loves God must love his brother also.
		</verse>
