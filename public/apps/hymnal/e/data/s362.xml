	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim
			Till all the world adore His sacred name.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Come, Christians, follow where our Captain trod,
			Our King victorious, Christ, the Son of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
			The hosts of God in conqu'ring ranks combine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All newborn soldiers of the Crucified
			Bear on their brows the seal, of Him who died.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
			As Thou hast promised, draw us all to Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So shall our song of triumph ever be:
			Praise to the Crucified for victory!
		</verse>
