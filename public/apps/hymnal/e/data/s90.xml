	<verses>
		<verse>
			Eternal God, whose power upholds
			Both flower and flaming star,
			To whom there is no here nor there,
			No time, no near nor far,
			No alien race, no foreign shore,
			No child unsought, unknown:
			O send us forth, Your prophets true,
			To make all lands Your own!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O God of truth, whom science seeks
			And reverent souls adore,
			Illumine every earnest mind
			Of every clime and shore:
			Dispel the gloom of error's night,
			Of ignorance and fear,
			Until true wisdom from above
			Shall make life's pathway clear!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O God of beauty, oft revealed
			In dreams of human art,
			In speech that flows to melody,
			In holiness of heart:
			Teach us to ban all ugliness,
			And all disharmony,
			Till all shall know the loveliness
			Of lives made fair and free!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O God of righteousness and grace,
			Seen in the Christ, Your Son,
			Whose life and death reveal Your face,
			By whom Your will was done;
			Help us to spread Your gracious reign
			Till greed and hate shall cease,
			And kindness dwell in human hearts,
			And all the earth find peace!
		</verse>
