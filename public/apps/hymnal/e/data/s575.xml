	<verses>
		<verse>
			Let your heart be broken for a world in need:
			Feed the mouths that hunger, Soothe the wounds that bleed,
			Give the cup of water and the loaf of bread
			Be the hands of Jesus, Serving in His stead.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Here on earth applying principles of love,
			Visible expression - God still rules above-
			Living illustration of the Living Word
			To the minds of all who've never seen or heard.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Blest to be a blessing, privilege to care,
			Challenged by the need? Apparent everywhere.
			Where mankind is wanting, fill the vacant place.
			Be the means through which the Lord reveals his Grace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Add to your believing Deeds that prove it true,
			Knowing Christ as Savior, Make Him Master, too.
			Follow in His foot-steps, Go where He has trod;
			In the world's great trouble Risk yourself for God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let your heart be tender and your vision clear;
			See mankind as God sees, serve Him far and near.
			Let your heart be broken by a brother's pain;
			Share your rich resources, give and give again.
		</verse>
