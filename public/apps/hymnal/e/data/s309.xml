		<verse>
			All to Jesus I surrender;
			all to him I freely give;
			I will ever love and trust him,
			in his presence daily live.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			I surrender all, I surrender all,
			all to thee, my blessed Savior,
			I surrender all.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			All to Jesus I surrender;
			humbly at his feet I bow,
			worldly pleasures all forsaken;
			take me, Jesus, take me now.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All to Jesus I surrender;
			make me, Savior, wholly thine;
			fill me with thy love and power;
			truly know that thou art mine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All to Jesus I surrender;
			now I feel the sacred flame.
			O the joy of full salvation!
			Glory, glory, to his name!
		</verse>
