	<eTitle>PRAYER -- Matthew 6 and 7, Jerusalem</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			"When you pray, do not imitate the hypocrites:
			they love to say their prayers standing up
			in the synagogues and at the street corners
			for people to see them.
			I tell you solemnly, they have had their reward.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"But when you pray,
			go to your private room and,
			when you have shut your door,
			pray to your Father who is in that secret place,
			and your Father who sees all that is done
			in secret will reward you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"In your prayers do not babble as the pagans do,
			for they think that by using many words
			they will make themselves heard.
			Do not be like them;
			your Father knows what you need
			before you ask him."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"If you forgive others their failings,
			your heavenly Father will forgive you yours;
			but if you do not forgive others,
			your Father will not forgive your failings either."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Ask, and it will be given to you;
			search, and you will find;
			knock, and the door will be opened to you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"For the one who asks always receives;
			the one who searches always finds;
			the one who knocks will always
			have the door opened to him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Is there a man among you who would hand his son
			a stone when he asked for bread?
			Or would hand him a snake when he asked for a fish?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"If you, then, who are evil,
			know how to give your children what is good,
			how much more will your Father in heaven
			give good things to those who ask him!"
		</verse>
