	<verses>
		<refrain>
			In a little while, In a little while,
			We shall cross the billow's foam;
			We shall meet at last, When the stormy winds are past,
			In a little while we're going home.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way,
			In a little while we're going home;
			For the night will end in the everlasting day,
			In a little while we're going home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We will do the work that our hands may find to do,
			In a little while we're going home;
			And the grace of God will our daily strength renew,
			In a little while we're going home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We will smooth the path for some weary, way-worn feet,
			In a little while we're going home;
			And may loving hearts spread around an influence sweet!
			In a little while we're going home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There's a rest beyond, there's relief from every care,
			In a little while we're going home;
			And no tears shall fall in that city bright and fair,
			In a little while we're going home.
		</verse>
