	<verses>
		<verse>
			The Spirit of the Lord revealed
			His will to saints of old;
			Their heart and mind lips unsealed
			His glory to unfold.
			Amid the gloom of ancient night
			They hailed the dawning Word,
			And in the coming of the light
			Proclaimed the coming Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The prophets passed; at length there came
			To sojourn and abide,
			The Word incarnate, to whose name
			The prophets testified;
			And He, the twilight overpast,
			Himself, the Light of light,
			As man with man, revealed at last
			The Father to our sight.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Eternal Spirit, who dost speak
			To mind and conscience still,
			That we in this our day, may seek
			To do our Father's will,
			To us the word of life impart,
			Of Christ, the living way;
			Give us the quiet, humble heart
			To hear and to obey.
		</verse>
