	<verses>
		<verse>
			Dear Lord, we come at set of sun,
			And at Your feet we kneel
			To worship You, Creator, King,
			This day, Your sign and seal.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Our earthly tasks we lay aside,
			According to Your Word,
			To enter now Your holy rest,
			The Sabbath of the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sweet Sabbath rest, your sacred hours
			Are as a golden chain
			That reaches back to Eden's gate
			And points us home again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And when this earth shall be renewed,
			And sin and death destroyed,
			Shall all redeemed each Sabbath day
			Still meet to praise their God.
		</verse>
