	<eTitle>HUMILITY -- Philippians 2, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			If you have any encouragement
			from being united with Christ,
			if any comfort from his love,
			if any fellowship with the Spirit,
			if any tenderness and compassion,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			then make my joy complete by being like-minded,
			having the same love,
			being one in spirit and purpose.
			Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit,
			but in humility consider others better than yourselves.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Each of you should look not only to your own interests,
			but also to the interests of others.
			Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:
			Who, being in very nature God,
			...made himself nothing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And being found in appearance as a man,
			he humbled himself and became obedient
			to death even death on a cross! *
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore, my dear friends,...
			continue to work out your salvation
			with fear and trembling,
			for it is God who works in you to will
			and to act according to his good purpose.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Do everything without complaining or arguing,
			so that you may become blameless and pure,
			children of God without fault in
			a crooked and depraved generation,
			in which you shine like stars in the universe.
		</verse>
