	<eTitle>THE LAW OF THE LORD IS PERFECT -- Psalm 19, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The law of the Lord is perfect,
			converting the soul;
			The testimony of the Lord is sure,
			making wise the simple;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The statutes of the Lord are right,
			rejoicing the heart;
			The commandment of the Lord is pure,
			enlightening the eyes.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The fear of the Lord is clean,
			enduring forever;
			The judgments of the Lord are true
			and righteous altogether.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			More to be desired are they than gold,
			Yea, than much fine gold;
			Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
			Moreover by them Your servant is warned,
			And in keeping them there is great reward.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who can understand his errors?
			Cleanse me from secret faults.
			Keep back Your servant also
			from presumptuous sins;
			Let them not have dominion over me.
			Then I shall be blameless,
			And I shall be innocent of great transgression.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let the words of my mouth
			and the meditation of my heart
			Be acceptable in Your sight,
			O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.
		</verse>
