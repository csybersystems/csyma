		<refrain>
			O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
			sent from the heart of God,
			hold us who wait before thee
			near to the heart of God.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			There is a place of quiet rest,
			near to the heart of God;
			a place where sin cannot molest,
			near to the heart of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There is a place of comfort sweet,
			near to the heart of God;
			a place where we our Savior meet,
			near to the heart of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There is place a place of full release,
			near to the heart of God;
			a place where all is joy and peace,
			near to the heart of God.
		</verse>
