		<verse>
			Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee,
			These children dear of mine, Thou gavest me;
			O, by Thy love divine, Lead them, my God, to Thee;
			Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When earth looks bright and fair, Festive and gay,
			Let no delusive snare Lure them astray;
			But from temptation's power, Lead them, my God, to Thee,
			Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			E'en for such little ones, Christ came a child,
			And in this world of sin Lived undefiled.
			O, for His sake, I pray, Lead them, my God, to Thee,
			Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yea, though my faith be dim, I would believe
			That Thou this precious gift Wilt now receive;
			O take their young hearts now, Lead them my God to Thee,
			Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.
		</verse>
