	<verses>
		<verse>
			In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
			Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
			When Thou see'st me waver, with a look recall,
			Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm;
			Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;
			Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,
			Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil, and woe,
			Or should pain attend me on my path below,
			Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see;
			Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.
		</verse>
