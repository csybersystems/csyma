	<eTitle>THE LORD'S SUPPER -- 1 Corinthians 11, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			I received from the Lord
			that which I also delivered to you:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			that the Lord Jesus on the same night
			in which He was betrayed took bread:
			and when He had given thanks,
			He broke it and said,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Take, eat; this is My body
			which is broken for you;
			do this in remembrance of Me."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the same manner He also took the
			cup after supper, saying,
			
			"This cup is the new covenant in My blood.
			This do, as often as you drink it,
			in remembrance of Me."
			
			For as often as you eat this bread
			and drink this cup,
			you proclaim the Lord's death till He comes.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore whoever eats this bread
			or drinks this cup of the Lord
			in an unworthy manner will be 
			guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But let a man examine himself,
			and so let him eat of that bread
			and drink of that cup.
		</verse>
