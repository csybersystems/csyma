	<verses>
		<verse>
			Soon shall the trump of God
			Give out the welcome sound,
			That shakes death's silent chamber walls,
			And breaks the turf sealed ground.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You dwellers in the dust,
			Awake, come forth, and sing;
			Sharp has your frost of winter been,
			But bright shall be your spring.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			'Twas sown in weakness here;
			'Twill then be raised in power;
			That which was sown in earthly seed  
			Shall rise a heav'nly flower.
		</verse>
