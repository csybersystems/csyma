	<verses>
		<verse>
			Father, lead me day by day,
			Ever in Thine own sweet way;
			Teach me to be pure and true;
			Show me what I ought to do.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When in danger, make me brave;
			Make me know that Thou canst save;
			Keep me safe by Thy dear side;
			Let me in Thy love abide.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When I'm tempted to do wrong,
			Make me steadfast, wise, and strong;
			And when all alone I stand,
			Shield me with Thy mighty hand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May I do the good I know,
			Be Thy loving child below,
			Then at last go home to Thee,
			Evermore Thy child to be.
		</verse>
