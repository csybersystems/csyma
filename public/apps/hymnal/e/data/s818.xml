	<eTitle>WHEN THE LORD BROUGHT BACK THE CAPTIVES -- Psalm 126, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			When the Lord brought back the captives to Zion,
			we were like men who dreamed.
			Our mouths were filled with laughter
			our tongue with songs of joy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then it was said among the nations,
			"The Lord has done great things for them."
			The Lord has done great things for us,
			and we are filled with joy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Restore our fortunes, 0 Lord,
			like streams in the Negev.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Those who sow in tears
			will reap with songs of joy.	
			He who goes out weeping,
			carrying seed to sow,	
			will return with songs of joy,
			carrying sheaves with him.
		</verse>
