	<verses>
		<verse>
			This is the threefold truth
			On which our faith depends;
			And with this joyful cry
			Worship begins and ends.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Christ had died! Christ has risen!
			Christ will come again!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			By this we are upheld 
			When doubt and grief assail
			Our Christian fortitude 
			And only grace avails
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This is the threefold truth 
			Which, if we hold it fast,
			Changes the world and us 
			And brings us home at last.
		</verse>
