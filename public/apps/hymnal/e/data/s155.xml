	<verses>
		<verse>
			When I survey the wondrous cross
			On which the Prince of glory died,
			My richest gain I count but loss,
			And pour contempt on all my pride.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
			Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
			Did e'er such love and sorrow meet?
			Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Since I, who was undone and lost,
			Have pardon through His name and word;
			Forbid it, then, that I should boast,
			Save in the cross of Christ my Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Were the whole realm of nature mine,
			That were a tribute far too small;
			Love so amazing, so divine,
			Demands my life, my soul, my all.
		</verse>
