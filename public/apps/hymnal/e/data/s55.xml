	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
			Bless Thy little lamb tonight;
			Through the darkness be Thou near me;
			Watch my sleep till morning light.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All this day Thy hand has led me,
			And I thank Thee for Thy care;
			Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me;
			Listen to my evening prayer.
		</verse>
