	<verses>
		<verse>
			How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
			Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
			What more can He say than to you He has said,
			To you who for refuge to Jesus hath fled?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed;
			For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
			I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
			Upheld by My rightious, omnipotent hand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When thro the deep waters  call thee to go,
			The rivers of  sorrow shall not go overflow
			For I will be with Thee, thy troubles to bless,
			And sanctify to Thee thy deepest destress.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When thro fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
			My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
			The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
			Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
			I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
			That soul, Though all hell should endeavor to shake,
			I'll never, no never, no never forsake.
		</verse>
