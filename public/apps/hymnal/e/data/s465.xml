		<verse>
			I heard the voice of Jesus say,
			"Come unto Me and rest;
			Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
			Thy head upon My breast."
			I came to Jesus as I was,
			Weary and worn and sad;
			I found in Him a resting place,
			And He has made me glad.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I heard the voice of Jesus say,
			"Behold, I freely give
			The living water; thirsty one,
			Stoop down and drink and live."
			I came to Jesus, and I drank
			Of that life giving stream;
			My thirst was quench'd, my soul revived,
			And now I live in Him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I heard the voice of Jesus say,
			"I am this dark world's light;
			Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
			And all thy day be bright."
			I looked to Jesus, and I found
			In Him my star, my sun;
			And in that light of  life I'll walk,
			Till trav'ling  days are done.
		</verse>
