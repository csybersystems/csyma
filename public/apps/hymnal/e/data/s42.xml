	<verses>
		<verse>
			Now that the daylight fills the sky,
			We lift our hearts to God on high,
			That He, in all we do or say,
			Would keep us free from harm today;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Would guard our hearts and tongues from strife;
			From anger's din would shield our life;
			From evil sights would turn our eyes,
			And close our ears to vanities;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So we, when this new day is gone
			And night in turn is drawing on,
			With conscience by the world unstained
			Shall praise His name for vict'ry gained.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"All praise to You, creator Lord!
			All praise to You, eternal Word!
			All praise to You, O Spirit wise!"
			We sing as daylight fills the skies.
		</verse>
