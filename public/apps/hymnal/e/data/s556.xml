	<verses>
		<verse>
			As saints of old their first-fruits brought
			Of orchard, flock, and field to God, the giver of all good,
			The source of bounteous yield;
			So we today first-fruits would bring,
			The wealth of this good land,
			Of farm and market, shop and home,
			Of mind and heart and hand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A world in need now summons us
			To labor, love, and give;
			To make our life an offering to God, that all may live,
			The church of Christ is calling us
			To make the dream come true:
			A world redeemed by Christ-like love;
			All life in Christ made new.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In gratitude and humble trust
			We bring our best today
			To serve Your cause and share Your love
			With all along life's way.
			O God, who gave Yourself to us
			In Jesus Christ Your Son,
			Teach us to give ourselves each day
			Until life's work is done.
		</verse>
