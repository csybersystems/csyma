	<eTitle>MEDITATION -- Joshua 1 and Psalms 119, 19, RSV.</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			This book of the law
			shall not depart out of your mouth,
			but you shall meditate on it day and night,
			that you may be careful to do according
			to all that is written in it;
			for then you shall make your way prosperous,
			and then you shall have good success.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I have laid up thy word in my heart,
			that I might not sin against thee....
			I will meditate on thy precepts,
			and fix my eyes on thy ways.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will delight in thy statutes;
			I will not forget thy word....
			I revere thy commandments, which I love,
			and I will meditate on thy statutes.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I remember thy name in the night,
			O Lord, and keep thy law....
			Oh, how I love thy law!
			It is my meditation all the day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thy commandment makes me wiser than my enemies,
			for it is ever with me.
			I have more understanding than all my teachers,
			for thy testimonies are my meditation.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I rise before dawn and cry for help;
			I hope in thy words.
			My eyes are awake before the watches of the night,
			that I may meditate upon thy promise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let the words of my mouth and the meditation
			of my heart be acceptable in thy sight,
			O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
		</verse>
