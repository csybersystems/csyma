		<refrain>
			Moment by moment I'm kept in His love;
			Moment by moment I've life from above;
			Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
			Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine,
			Living with Jesus, a new life divine,
			Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
			Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Never a trial that He is not there,
			Never a burden that He doth not bear,
			Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
			Moment by moment I'm under His care.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Never a heartache, and never a groan,
			Never a teardrop and never a moan;
			Never a danger but there on the throne,
			Moment by moment He thinks of His own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
			Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
			Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
			Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.
		</verse>
