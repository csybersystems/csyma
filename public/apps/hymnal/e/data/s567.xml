		<verse>
			Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! 
			Thou art the potter, I am the clay.
			Mold me and make me after thy will,
			while I am waiting, yielded and still.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
			Search me and try me, Savior today!
			Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
			as in thy presence humbly I bow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
			Wounded and weary, help me I pray!
			Power, all power, surely is thine!
			Touch me and heal me, Savior divine!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! 
			Hold o'er my being absolute sway.
			Fill with thy Spirit till all shall see
			Christ only, always, living in me!
