	<verses>
		<verse>
			Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
			who has blessed us in Christ
			with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In him we have redemption through his blood,
			the forgiveness of our trespasses, 
			according to the riches of his grace 
			which he lavished upon us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In him you also, who have heard the word of truth,
			the gospel of your salvation, and have believed in him,
			were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
			which is the guarantee of our inheritance 
			until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off
			have been brought near in the blood of Christ.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He came and preached peace to you 
			who were far off and peace to those who were near;
			for through him we both have access 
			in one Spirit to the Father.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There is one body and one Spirit, 
			just as you were called to the one hope 
			that belongs to your call, one Lord, one faith, 
			one baptism, one God and Father of us all,
			who is above all and through all and in all.
		</verse>
