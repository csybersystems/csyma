	<eTitle>Make Me a Captive, Lord</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Make me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free;
			Force me to render up my sword, and I shall conqueror be.
			I sink in life's alarms when by myself I stand;
			Imprison me within Thine arms, and strong shall be my hand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My heart is weak and poor till it a master find;
			It has no spring of action sure-it varies with the wind.
			It cannot freely move till Thou hast wrought its chain;
			Enslave it with Thy matchless love, and deathless it shall reign.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My will is not my own till Thou hast made it Thine;
			If it would reach a monarch's throne it must its crown resign;
			It only stands unbent, amid the clashing strife,
			When on Thy bosom it as leant and found in Thee its life.
		</verse>
