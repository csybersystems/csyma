	<verses>
		<verse>
			Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
			snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
			weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
			tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
			Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,
			waiting the penitent child to receive;
			plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
			he will forgive if they only believe.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
			strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
			back to the narrow way patiently win them;
			tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died
		</verse>
