		<verse>
			Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;
			No other help I know;
			If Thou withdraw Thyself from me,
			Ah, wither shall I go?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			On Thy dear Son I now believe,
			O let me feel Thy power;
			And all my varied wants relieve,
			In this accepted hour.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Author of faith! To Thee I lift
			My weary, longing eyes;
			O let me now receive that gift;
			My soul without it dies.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Surely Thou canst not let me die;
			O speak, and I shall live;
			And here I will unwearied lie,
			Till Thou Thy Spirit give.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How would my fainting soul rejoice
			Could I but see Thy face!
			Now let me hear Thy quickening voice,
			And taste Thy pardoning grace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I do believe, I now believe
			That Jesus died for me,
			And that He shed His precious blood
			From sin to set me free.
		</verse>
