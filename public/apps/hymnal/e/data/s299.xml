	<eTitle>Forgive Our Sins as We Forgive</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			"Forgive our sins as we forgive,"
			You taught us, Lord, to pray;
			But You alone can grant us grace
			To live the words we say.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How can Your pardon reach and bless
			The unforgiving heart
			That broods on wrongs and will not let
			Old bitterness depart?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In blazing light Your cross reveals
			The truth we dimly knew:
			How trifling others' debts to us;
			How great our debt to You!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls
			And bid resentment cease;
			Then, by Your mercy reconciled,
			Our lives will spread Your peace.
		</verse>
