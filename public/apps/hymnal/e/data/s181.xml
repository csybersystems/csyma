	<eTitle>Does Jesus Care?</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<refrain>
			O yes, He cares I know He cares!
			His heart is touched with my grief;
			When the days are weary,
			The long nights dreary,
			I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
			Too deeply for mirth and song;
			As the burdens press, and the cares distress,
			And the way grows weary and long?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Does Jesus care when my way is dark
			With a nameless dread and fear?
			As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
			Does He care enough to be near?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye
			To the dearest on earth to me,
			And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks;
			Is it aught to Him? Does He see?
		</verse>
