	<eTitle>PREPARATION FOR CHRIST'S COMING -- 1 Thessalonians 5, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			You know very well that the day of the Lord
			will come like a thief in the night.
			While people are saying, "Peace and safety,"
			destruction will come on them suddenly,
			as labor pains on a pregnant woman,
			and they will not escape.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But you, brothers, are not in darkness
			so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
			You are all sons of the light and sons of the day.
			We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep,
			but let us be alert and self-controlled.
			For those who sleep, sleep at night,
			and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But since we belong to the day,
			let us be self-controlled,
			putting on faith and love as a breastplate,
			and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath
			but to receive salvation
			through our Lord Jesus Christ.
			He died for us so that,
			whether we are awake or asleep,
			we may live together with him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore encourage one another
			and build each other up,
			just as in fact you are doing.
		</verse>
