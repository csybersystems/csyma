	<eTitle>O COME, LET US SING UNTO THE LORD -- Psalm 95, KJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			O come, let us sing unto the Lord:
			let us make a joyful noise
			to the rock of our salvation.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving,
			and make a joyful noise unto him, with psalms.
			For the Lord is a great God, 
			and a great King above all gods.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In his hand are the deep places of the earth:
			the strength of the hills is his also. 
			The sea is his, and he made it: 
			and his hands formed the dry land.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O come, let us worship and bow down:
			let us kneel before the Lord our maker.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For he is our God;
			and we are the people of his pasture, 
			and the sheep of his hand.
		</verse>
