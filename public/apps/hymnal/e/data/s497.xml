		<verse>
			O gracious Father of mankind,
			Our spirits' unseen friend;
			High heaven's Lord, our hearts' dear guest,
			To Thee our prayers ascend.
			Thou dost not wait till human speech
			Thy gifts divine implore;
			Our dreams, our aims, our work, our lives
			Are prayers Thou lovest more.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou hearest these, the good and ill,
			Deep buried in each breast;
			The secret thought, the hidden plan,
			Wrought out our unexpressed.
			O cleanse our prayers from human dross,
			Attune our lives to Thee,
			Until we labor for those gifts
			We ask on bended knee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Our best is but Thyself in us,
			Our highest thought Thy will;
			To hear Thy voice we need but love,
			And listen, and be still.
			We would not bend Thy will to ours,
			But blend our wills to Thine;
			Not dreams, our aims, our work, our lives
			Are prayers Thou lovest more.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou seekest us in love and truth
			More than our minds seek Thee;
			Through open gates Thy power flows in
			Like flood tides from the sea.
			No more we seek Thee from afar,
			Nor ask Thee for a sign,
			Content to pray in life and love
			And toil, till all are Thine.
		</verse>
