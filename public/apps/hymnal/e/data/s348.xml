	<verses>
		<verse>
			The church's one foundation
			'Tis Jesus Christ her Lord;
			She is his new creation
			By water and the Word.
			From heaven he came and sought her
			To be his holy bride;
			With his own blood he bought her,
			And for her life he died.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Elect from every nation,
			Yet one o'er all the earth;
			Her charter of salvation,
			One Lord, one faith, one birth;
			One holy name she blesses,
			Partakes one holy food,
			And to one hope she presses,
			With every grace endued.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though with a scornful wonder
			We see her sore oppressed,
			Though foes would rend asunder,
			The Rock where she doth rest,
			Yet saints their faith are keeping;
			Their cry goes up, "How long?"
			And soon the night of weeping
			Shall be the morn of song.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			'Mid toil and tribulation,
			And tumult of her war,
			She waits the consummation
			Of peace forevermore;
			Till, with the vision glorious, 
			Her longing eyes are blest, 
			And the great church victorious
			Shall be the church at rest.
		</verse>
