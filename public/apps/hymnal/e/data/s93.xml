	<verses>
		<verse>
			All things bright and beautiful,
			All creatures great and small,
			All things wise and wonderful,
			The Lord God made them all.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Each little flower that opens,
			Each little bird that sings;
			He made their glowing colors,
			He made their tiny wings.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The purpleheaded mountain,
			The river running by
			The sunset, and the morning
			That brightens up the sky,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The cold wind in the winter,
			The pleasant summer sun,
			The ripe fruits in the garden,
			He made them every one.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He gave us eyes to see them,
			And lips that we might tell
			How great is God Almighty,
			Who has made all things well.
		</verse>
