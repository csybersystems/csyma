	<eTitle>REWARD OF THE SAINTS -- Isaiah 35, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The desert and the parched land will be glad;
			the wilderness will rejoice and blossom.
			Like the crocus, it will burst into bloom;
			it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The glory of Lebanon will be given to it,
			the splendor of Carmel and Sharon;
			they will see the glory of the Lord,
			the splendor of our God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Strengthen the feeble hands,
			steady the knees that give way;
			say to those with fearful hearts,
			"Be strong, do not fear;
			your God will come,
			he will come with vengeance;
			with divine retribution
			he will come to save you."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then will the eyes of the blind be opened
			and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
			Then will the lame leap like a deer,
			and the tongue of the dumb shout for joy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Water will gush forth in the wilderness
			and Streams in the desert.
			The burning sand will become a pool,
			the thirsty ground bubbling springs.
			In the haunts where jackals once lay,
			grass and reeds and papyrus will grow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And a highway will be there;
			it will be called the Way of Holiness.
			The unclean will not journey on it;
			it will be for those who walk in that Way;
			wicked fools will not go about on it.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			No lion will be there,
			nor will any ferocious beast get up on it;
			they will not be found there.
			But only the redeemed will walk there,
			and the ransomed of the Lord will return.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			They will enter Zion with singing;
			everlasting joy will crown their heads.
			Gladness and joy will overtake them,
			and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
		</verse>
