	<eTitle>THE GLORIFIED CHRIST -- Mark 16,1 Corinthians 15, and Revelation 1, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them,
			he was taken up into heaven
			and he sat at the right hand of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If Christ has not been raised,
			our preaching is useless and so is your faith....
			But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead,
			the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Among the lampstands was someone "like a son of man,"
			dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet
			and with a golden sash around his chest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His head and hair were white like wool,
			as white as snow,
			and his eyes were like blazing fire.
			His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace,
			and his voice was like the sound of	rushing waters.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In his right hand he held seven stars,
			and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword.
			His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead.
			Then he placed his right hand on me and said:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.
			I am the Living One; I was dead,
			and behold I am alive for ever and ever!
			And I hold the keys of death and Hades."
		</verse>
