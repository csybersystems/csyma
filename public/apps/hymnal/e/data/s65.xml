		<verse>
			God be with you till we meet again;
			By His counsels guide, uphold you,
			With His sheep securely fold you;
			God be with you till we meet again.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Till we meet, till we meet,
			Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
			Till we meet, till we meet,
			God be with you till we meet again.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			God be with you till we meet again;
			'Neath His wings securely hide you;
			Daily manna still provide you;
			God be with you till we meet again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God be with you till we meet again;
			When life's perils thick confound you;
			Put His arms unfailing round you;
			God be with you till we meet again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God be with you till we meet again;
			Keep love's banner floating over you,
			Strike death's threatening wave before you;
			God be with you till we meet again.
		</verse>
