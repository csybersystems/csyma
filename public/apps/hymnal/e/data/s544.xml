	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, Son of blessed Mary,
			Once on earth a little child,
			Pattern fair of holy living,
			Gracious, loving, undefiled:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though Thy eager heart was yearning
			Heavy laden souls to free,
			Yet Thou calledst little children
			In their happiness to Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Grant that we, like little children,
			Free from pride and guile may be;
			Cheerful, trusting, safe, protected
			By the blessed Trinity.
		</verse>
