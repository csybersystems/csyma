	<verses>
		<verse>
			Abide with me, 'tis eventide!
			The day is past and gone;
			The shadows of the evening fall;
			The night is coming on!
			Within my heart a welcome guest,
			Within my home abide;
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			O Savior, stay this night with me;
			Behold, 'tis eventide!
			O Savior, stay this night with me;
			Behold, 'tis eventide.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Abide with me, 'tis eventide!
			Thy walk today with me
			Has made my heart within me burn,
			As I communed with Thee.
			Thy earnest words have filled my soul
			And kept me near Thy side;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Abide with me, 'tis eventide!
			And lone will be the night,
			If I cannot commune with Thee,
			Nor find in Thee my light.
			The darkness of the world, I fear,
			Would in my home abide;
		</verse>
