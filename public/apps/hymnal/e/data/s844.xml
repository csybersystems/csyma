	<eTitle>THE INCARNATE WORD -- 1 John 1, Jerusalem</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Something which has existed since the beginning,
			that we have heard,
			and we have seen with our own eyes;
			that we have watched and touched with our hands:
			the Word, who is life this is our subject.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			That life was made visible:
			we saw it and we are giving our testimony,
			telling you of the eternal life
			which was with the Father
			and has been made visible to us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What we have seen and heard
			we are telling you so that you too
			may be in union with us,
			as we are in union with the Father
			and with his Son Jesus Christ.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We are writing this to you
			to make our own joy complete.
