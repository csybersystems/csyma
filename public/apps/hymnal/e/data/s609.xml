	<verses>
		<verse>
			Am I a soldier of the cross,
			a follower of the Lamb,
			and shall I fear to own his cause,
			or blush to speak his name?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Must I be carried to the skies
			on flowery beds of ease,
			while others fought to win the prize,
			and sailed through bloody seas?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Are there no foes for me to face?
			Must I not stem the flood?
			Is this vile world a friend of grace,
			to help me on to God?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
			increase my courage, Lord.
			I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
			supported by thy word.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thy saints in all this glorious war
			shall conquer though they die;
			they see the triumph from afar,
			with faith's discerning eye.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When that illustrious day shall rise,
			and all thy armies shine
			in robes of victory through the skies,
			the glory shall be thine.
		</verse>
