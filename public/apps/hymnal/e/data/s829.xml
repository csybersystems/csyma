	<eTitle>A NOBLE WIFE -- Proverbs 31, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Who can find a virtuous wife?
			For her worth is far above rubies.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The heart of her husband safely trusts her;
			So he will have no lack of gain.
			She does him good and not evil
			All the days of her life.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			She seeks wool and flax,
			And willingly works with her hands.
			She also rises while it is yet night,
			And provides food for her house hold,
			And a portion for her maidservants.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			She girds herself with strength,
			And strengthens her arms....
			She extends her hand to the poor,
			Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Strength and honor are her clothing;
			She shall rejoice in time to come.
			She opens her mouth with wisdom,
			And on her tongue is the law of kindness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			She watches over the ways of her household,
			And does not eat the bread of idleness.
			Her children rise up and call her blessed;
			Her husband also, and he praises her.
		</verse>
