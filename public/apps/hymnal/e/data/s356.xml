	<verses>
		<verse>
			All who love and serve your city,
			All who bear its daily stress,
			All who cry for peace and justice,
			All who curse and all who bless.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In your day of loss and sorrow,
			In your day of helpless strife,
			Honor, peace, and love retreating,
			Seek the Lord, who is your life.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For all days are days of judgment,
			And the Lord is waiting still,
			Drawing near His friends who spurn Him,
			Off'ring peace from Calv'ry's hill.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Risen Lord, shall yet the city
			Be the city of despair?
			Come today, our judge, our glory;
			Be its name "The Lord is there!"
		</verse>
