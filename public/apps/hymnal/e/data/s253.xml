		<verse>
			There's no other name like Jesus,
			'Tis the dearest name we know,
			'Tis the angel's joy in heaven,
			'Tis the Christian's joy below.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Sweet name, (sweet name) dear name, (dear name)
			There's no other name like Jesus;
			Sweet name, (sweet name) dear name, (dear name)
			There's no other name like Jesus.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			There's no other name like Jesus
			When the heart with grief is sad,
			There's no other name like Jesus
			When the heart is free and glad.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			'Tis the hope that I shall see Him
			When in glory He appears,
			'Tis the hope to hear His welcome
			That my fainting spirit cheers.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If He wills that I should labor
			In His vineyard day by day,
			Then 'tis well if only Jesus
			Blesses all I do or say.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If He wills that death's cold finger
			Touch my feeble, mortal clay,
			Then 'tis well if only Jesus
			Is my dying trust and stay.
		</verse>
