	<eTitle>THE LORD'S WORK -- Isaiah 61, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me,
			because the Lord has anointed me
			to preach good news to the poor.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
			to proclaim freedom for the captives
			and release for the prisoners,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor
			and the day of vengeance of our God,
			to comfort all who mourn,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			and provide for those who grieve in Zion
			to bestow on them a crown of beauty
			instead of ashes, the oil of gladness
			instead of mourning,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.
			They will be called oaks of righteousness,
			a planting of the Lord
			for the display of his splendor.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I delight greatly in the Lord;
			my soul rejoices in my God.
			For he has clothed me with garments of salvation
			and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness,
			as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest,
			and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For as the soil makes the sprout come up
			and a garden causes seeds to grow,
			so the Sovereign Lord will make righteousness
			and praise spring up before all nations.
		</verse>
