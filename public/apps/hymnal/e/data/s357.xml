		<verse>
			Come, labor on.
			Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain
			While all around him waves the golden grain?
			And to each servant does the Master say,
			"Go work today."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, labor on.
			Claim the high calling angels cannot share;
			To young and old the gospel gladness bear;
			Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.
			The night draws nigh.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, labor on.
			No time for rest; till glows the western sky,
			Till the long shadows o'r our pathway lie,
			And a glad sound comes with the setting sun,
			"Well done, well done!"
		</verse>
