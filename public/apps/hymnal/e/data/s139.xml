	<verses>
		<verse>
			While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
			All seated on the ground,
			The angel of the Lord came down,
			And glory shone around.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Fear not! said he- for mighty dread
			Had seized their troubled mind-
			Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
			To you and all mankind.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To you, in David's town this day,
			Is born of David's line,
			The Savior who is Christ the Lord;
			And this shall be the sign:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The heavenly Babe you there shall find
			To human view displayed,
			All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
			And in a manger laid.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thus spake the seraph; and forth-with
			Appeared a shinning throng
			Of angels praising God on high,
			Who thus addressed their song:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"All glory be to God on high,
			And to the earth be peace;
			Good will hence forth heaven to men,
			Begin and never cease."
		</verse>
