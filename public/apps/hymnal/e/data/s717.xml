	<eTitle>THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE GLORY OF GOD -- Psalm 19, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The heavens declare the glory of God;
			the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
			Day after day they pour forth speech;
			night after night they display knowledge.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There is no speech or language
			where their voice is not heard.
			Their voice goes out into all the earth,
			their words to the ends of the world.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun,
			which is like a bridegroom
			coming forth from his pavilion,
			like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It rises at one end of the heavens
			and makes its circuit to the other;
			nothing is hidden from its heat.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The heavens declare the glory of God;
			the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
		</verse>
