	<verses>
		<verse>
			The church has waited long
			Her absent Lord to see;
			And still in loneliness she waits,
			A friendless stranger she.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How long, O Lord our God,
			Holy and true and good,
			Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering church,
			Her sighs and tears and blood?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We long to hear Thy voice,
			To see Thee face to face,
			To share Thy crown and glory then,
			As now we share Thy grace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, Lord, and wipe away
			The curse, the sin, the stain,
			And make this blighted world of ours
			Thine own fair world again.
		</verse>
