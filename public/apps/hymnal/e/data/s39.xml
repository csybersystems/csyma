	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear
			My voice ascending high;
			To Thee will I direct my prayer,
			To Thee lift up mine eye-
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Up to the hills where Christ is gone
			To plead for all His saints,
			Presenting at His Father's throne
			Our songs and our complaints.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O may Thy Spirit guide my feet
			In ways of righteousness;
			Make every path of duty straight
			And plain before my face.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The men that love and fear Thy name
			Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
			The mighty God will compass them
			With favor as a shield.
		</verse>
