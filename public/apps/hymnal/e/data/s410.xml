	<verses>
		<verse>
			Thy broken body, gracious Lord,
			Is shadowed by this broken bread;
			The wine which in this cup is poured,
			Points to the blood which Thou hast shed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And while we meet together thus,
			We show that we are one in Thee;
			Thy precious blood was shed for us,
			Thy death, O Lord, hast set us free!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We have one hope that Thou wilt come,
			Thee in the air we wait to see;
			When Thou wilt give Thy saints a home,
			And we shall ever reign with Thee.
		</verse>
