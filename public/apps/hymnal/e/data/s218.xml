		<verse>
			When He cometh, when He cometh
			To make up His jewels,
			All His jewels, precious jewels,
			His loved and His own.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Like the stars of the morning,
			His bright crown adorning,
			They shall shine in their beauty,
			Bright gems for His crown.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			He will gather, He will gather
			The gems for His kingdom,
			All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
			His loved and His own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Little children, little children
			Who love their Redeemer,
			Are the jewels, precious jewels,
			His loved and His own.
		</verse>
