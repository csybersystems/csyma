	<verses>
		<verse>
			Now thank we all our God,
			with heart and hands and voices,
			who wondrous things hath done,
			in whom this world rejoices;
			who from our mothers' arms
			has blessed us on our way
			with countless gifts of love,
			and still is ours today.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O may this bounteous God
			through all our life be near us,
			with ever joyful hearts
			and blessed peace to cheer us;
			and keep us in His grace,
			and guide us when perplexed;
			and free us from all ills,
			in this world and the next.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All praise and thanks to God
			the Father now be given;
			the Son, and him who reigns
			with them in highest heaven;
			the one eternal God,
			whom earth and heaven adore;
			for thus it was, is now,
			and shall be evermore.
		</verse>
