		<verse>
			Alleluia! sing to Jesus!
			His the scepter, His the throne;
			Alleluia! His the triumph,
			His the victory alone;
			Hark! the songs of peaceful Sion
			Thunder like a mighty flood;
			Jesus out of every nation
			Hath redeemed us by His blood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Alleluia! not as orphans
			Are we left in sorrow now;
			Alleluia! He is near us,
			Faith believes, nor questions how:
			Though the cloud from sight received Him,
			When the forty days were o'er,
			Shall our hearts forget His promise,
			"I am with you evermore"?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Alleluia! Bread of heaven,
			Thou on earth our food, our stay!
			Alleluia! here the sinful
			Flee to Thee from day to day:
			Intercessor, Friend of sinners,
			Earth's Redeemer plead for me,
			Where the songs of all the sinless
			Sweep across the crystal sea.
