	<eTitle>I Vow to Thee, My Country</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,
			Entire the whole and perfect, the service of my love:
			The love that asks the reason, The love that stands the test,
			That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;
			The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,
			The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And there's another country, I've heard long ago,
			Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;
			We may not count her armies, We may not see her King;
			Her fortress is a faithful heart, Her pride is suffering;
			And one by one and fervently we pray for her increase,
			And her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace.
		</verse>
