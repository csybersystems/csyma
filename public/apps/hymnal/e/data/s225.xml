		<verse>
			God is working His purpose out
			As year suceeds to year;
			God is working His purpose out,
			And the time is drawing near;
			Nearer and nearer draws the time,
			The time that shall surely be
			When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
			As the waters cover the sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			From utmost east to utmost west,
			Where'er man's foot hath trod,
			By the mouth of many messengers
			Goes forth the voice of God;
			Give ear to me, ye confinents,
			Ye isles, give ear to me,
			That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
			As the waters cover the sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			March we forth in the strength of God
			With the banner of Christ unfurled,
			That the light of the glorious gospel of truth
			May shine throughout the world:
			Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin
			To set their captives free,
			That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
			As the waters cover the sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All we can do is nothing worth
			Unless God blesses the deed;
			Vainly we hope for the harvest tide
			Till God gives life to teh seed;
			Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,
			The time that shall surely be,
			When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
			As the waters cover the sea.
