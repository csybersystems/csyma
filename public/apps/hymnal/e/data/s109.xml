		<verse>
			Marvelous grace of our loving Lord.
			Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!
			Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured
			There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Grace, grace, God's grace,
			Marvelouse grace, infinite grace)
			Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
			Grace, grace, God's grace,
			(Marvelouse grace, infinite grace)
			Grace that is greater than all our sin!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Sin and despair, like the seawaves cold,
			Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
			Grace that is greater yes grace untold
			Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
			Freely bestowed on all who believe!
			You that are longing to see His face,
			Will you this moment His grace receive?
		</verse>
