		<verse>
			For sunrise hope and sunset calm,
			and all that lies between,
			For all the sweetness and the balm
			that is and that has been,
			For comradeship, for peace in strife,
			and light on darkened days;
			For work to do and strength for life
			we sing our hymn of praise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But O, we press far,
			far above these gifts of pure delight,
			And find in Thee,
			and in Thy love contentment infinite.
			O Lord, beloved in whom are found
			all joys of time and place,
			What will it be when joy is crowned
			by vision of Thy face?
		</verse>
