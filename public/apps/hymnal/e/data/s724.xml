	<eTitle>O LORD, YOU HAVE SEARCHED ME -- Psalm 139, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			O Lord, You have searched me and known me.
			You know my sitting down and my rising up;
			You understand my thought afar off.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You comprehend my path and my lying down,
			And are acquainted with all my ways.
			For there is not a word on my tongue,
			But behold, 0 Lord,	You know it altogether.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You have hedged me behind and before,
			And laid Your hand upon me.
			Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
			It is high, I cannot attain it.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Where can I go from Your Spirit?
			Or where can I flee from Your presence?
			If I ascend into heaven, You are there;
			If I make my bed in hell,
			behold, You are there.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If I take the wings of the morning,
			And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
			Even there Your hand shall lead me,
			And Your right hand shall hold me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If I say, "Surely the darkness shall fall on me,"
			Even the night shall be light about me;
			Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You,
			But the night shines as the day;
			The darkness and the light are both alike to You.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For You have formed my inward parts;
			You have covered me in my mother's womb.
			I will praise You,
			for I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
			Marvelous are Your works,
			And that my soul knows very well.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Search me, 0 God, and know my heart;
			Try me, and know my anxieties;
			And see if there is any wicked way in me,
			And lead me in the way everlasting.
		</verse>
