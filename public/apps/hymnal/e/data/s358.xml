		<refrain>
			Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
			Hear us, Lord, to Thee we cry;
			Send them now the sheaves to gather,
			Ere the harvest time pass by.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Far and near the fields, are teeming
			With the sheaves of ripened grain;
			Far and near their gold is gleaming,
			O'er the sunny slope and plain.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Send them forth with morn's first beaming,
			Send them in the noontide's glare;
			When the sun's last rays are streming,
			Bid them gather everywhere.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,
			Gather now the sheaves of gold;
			Heavenward then at evening wending
			Thou shalt come with joy untold.
		</verse>
