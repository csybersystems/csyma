		<verse>
			The Son of God proclaim,
			The Lord of time and space;
			The God who bade the light break forth
			Now shines in Jesus' face.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Behold His out stretched  hands,
			Though all was in His power
			He took the towel and basin then,
			And serves us in this hour.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He, God's creative word,
			The church's Lord and head,
			Here bids us gather as His friends,
			And share His wine and bread.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord of life and death
			With wondering praise we sing;
			We break the bread at His command,
			And name Him God and King.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We take this cup in hope:
			For He, who gladly bore
			The shameful cross, is ris'n again,
			And reigns forevermore.
		</verse>
