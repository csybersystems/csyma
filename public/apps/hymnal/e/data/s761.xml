	<eTitle>RIGHTEOUSNESS BY FAITH -- Romans 3, 8, and 1 Corinthians 1, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Righteousness from God comes through faith
			in Jesus Christ to all who believe.
			There is no difference,
			for all have sinned and fall short of
			the glory of God,
			and are justified freely by his grace
			through the redemption that came
			by Christ Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement,
			through faith in his blood.
			He did this to demonstrate his justice,
			because in his forbearance he had
			left the sins committed beforehand unpunished
		</verse>
		<verse>
			he did it to demonstrate his justice at
			the present time, so as to be just
			and the one who justifies
			the man who has faith in Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore, there is now no condemnation
			for those who are in Christ Jesus,
			because through Christ Jesus
			the law of the Spirit of life set me
			free from the law of sin and death.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What, then, shall we say in response to this?
			If God is for us, who can be against us?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He who did not spare his own Son,
			but gave him up for us allhow will he not also,
			along with him,
			graciously give us all things?
			Who will bring any charge against those
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who will bring any charge against those
			whom God has chosen?
			It is God who justifies.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It is because of him
			that you are in Christ Jesus,
			who has become for us wisdom from God
			that is, our righteousness,
			holiness and redemption.
