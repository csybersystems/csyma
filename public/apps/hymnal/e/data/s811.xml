	<eTitle>PEACE -- Psalm 133, 1 Corinthians 1, Romans 14, James 3, and 2 Corinthians 13, TEV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			How wonderful it is, how pleasant,
			for God's people to live together in harmony!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ
			I appeal to all of you, my brothers,
			to agree in what you say,
			so that there will be no divisions among you.
			Be completely united, with only one thought
			and one purpose.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So then, we must always aim at those
			things that bring peace	
			and I that help strengthen one another.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The wisdom from above is pure first of all;
			it is also peaceful, gentle, and friendly;
			it is full of compassion and produces
			a harvest of good deeds;
			it is free from prejudice and hypocrisy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And goodness is the harvest that is produced
			from the seeds the peacemakers plant in peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Strive for perfection; listen to my appeals;
			agree with one another; live in peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And the God of love and peace will be with you.
		</verse>
