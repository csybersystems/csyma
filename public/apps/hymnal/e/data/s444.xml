		<refrain>
			I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger;
			I can tarry, I can tarry but a night.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger;
			I can tarry, I can tarry but a night;
			Do not detain me, for I am going
			To where the fountains are ever flowing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There the glory is ever shining!
			O, my longing heart, my longing heart is there;
			Here in this country so dark and dreary,
			I long have wandered forlorn and weary.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There's the city to which I journey;
			My Redeemer, my Redeemer is its light!
			There is no sorrow, nor any sighing,
			Nor any tears there, or any dying.
		</verse>
