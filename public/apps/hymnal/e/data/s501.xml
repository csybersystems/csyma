	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Blessed hour of prayer,
			Blessed hour of prayer,
			What a balm for the weary!
			O how sweet to be there!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
			And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and friend;
			If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
			What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,
			With a tender compassion His children to hear;
			When He tells us we may cast at His feet ev'ry care,
			What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried
			To the Savior who loves them their sorrow confide;
			With a sympathizing heart He removes ev'ry care;
			What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him, we believe
			That the blessing we're needing we'll surely receive;
			In the fullness of this trust we shall lose ev'ry care;
			What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!
