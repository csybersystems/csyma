		<verse>
			Fight the good fight with all thy might,
			Christ is thy strength and Christ thy right;
			Lay hold on life and it shall be
			Thy joy and crown eternally.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Run the straight race through God's good grace;
			Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face.
			Life with its path before us lies;
			Christ is the way, and Christ the prize.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Cast care aside, lean on thy guide;
			His boundless mercy will provide;
			Trust, and the trusting soul shall prove
			Christ is its life, and Christ its love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near;
			He changeth not and thou art dear.
			Only believe, and thou shalt see
			That Christ is all in all to thee.
		</verse>
