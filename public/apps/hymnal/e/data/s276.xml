		<verse>
			Thanks to God whose Word was spoken
			In the deed that made the earth.
			His the voice that called a nation;
			His the fires that tried her worth.
			God has spoken;
			Praise Him for His open Word.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thanks to God whose Word incarnate
			Glorified the flesh of man.
			Deeds and words and death and rising
			Tell the grace in heaven's plan.
			God has spoken;
			Praise Him for His open Word.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thanks to God whose Word is answered
			By the Spirit's voice wihin.
			Here we drink of joy unmeasured,
			Life redeemed from death and sin.
			God is speaking;
			Praise Him for His open Word.
