	<eTitle>THE ASCENSION -- Acts 1, NEB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			[Jesus] showed himself to these men	after his death,
			and gave ample proof that he was alive:
			over a period of forty days he appeared to them 
			and taught them about the kingdom of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			While he was in their company he told them 
			not to leave Jerusalem. "You must wait," he said,
			"for the promise made by my Father,
			about which you have heard me speak:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"John, as you know, baptized with water,
			but you will be baptized with the
			Holy Spirit, and within the next few days."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So, when they were all together,
			they asked him, "Lord, is this the time 
			when you are to establish once
			again the sovereignty of Israel?"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He answered,
			"It is not for you to know about dates or times,
			which the Father has set within	his own control.
			But you will receive power when the
			Holy Spirit comes upon you;
			and you will bear witness for me in	Jerusalem, 
			and all over Judaea and Samaria,
			and away to the ends of the earth."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When he had said this, as they watched,
			he was lifted up, and a cloud removed him from
			their sight. As he was going,
			and as they were gazing intently into the sky,
			all at once there stood beside them
			two men in white who said,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Men of Galilee,
			why stand there looking up into the sky?
			This Jesus, who has been taken away
			from you up to heaven,
			will come in the same way as you
			have seen him go."
