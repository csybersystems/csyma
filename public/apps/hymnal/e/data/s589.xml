		<verse>
			Holy Spirit, gracious guest,
			Hear and grant our heart's request
			For that gift supreme and best
			Holy heav'nly love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Faith that mountains could remove,
			Tongues of earth or heaven above,
			Knowledge, all things,
			Empty prove If I have no love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though I as a martyr bleed,
			Give my goods the poor to feed,
			All is vain if love I need:
			Therefore give me love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Love is kind and suffers long,
			Love is pure and thinks no wrong;
			Love than death ifself more strong:
			Therefore give us love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Prophecy will fade away,
			Melting in the light of day;
			Love will ever with us stay:
			Therefore give us love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Faith and hope and love we see
			Joining hand in hand agree-
			But the greatest of the three,
			And the best is love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy spirit gracious guest,
			Hear and grant our heart request
			For that gift supreme and best
			Holy heav'nly love.
