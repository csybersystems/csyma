			"'All the tithe of the land,
			whether of the seed of the land
			or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's.
			It is holy to the Lord.'"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Will a man rob God?
			Yet you have robbed Me!
			But you say,
			'In what way have we robbed You.'
			In tithes and offerings.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"You are cursed with a curse,
			For you have robbed Me,
			Even this whole nation.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Bring all the tithes into the storehouse,
			That there may be food in My house,
			And prove Me now in this,"
			says the Lord of hosts,
			"If I will not open for you
			the windows of heaven
			And pour out for you such blessing
			That there will not be room enough to receive it.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,
			So that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground,
			Nor shall the vine fail to bear fruit
			for you in the field."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"And all nations will call you blessed,
			For you will be a delightful land,"
			Says the Lord of hosts.
