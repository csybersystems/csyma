		<refrain>
			Over yonder, down by the crystal sea,
			                      
			down
			             by the crystal sea,
			Over yonder, there's where I long to be,
			                      
			There's            where I long to be,
			No more sorrow, toil, grief, nor care,
			In the homeland bright and fair,
			Over, over there.
			                  Over there.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Come let us sing of homeland,
			Down by the crystal sea;
			Wonderful land where Jesus
			Buildeth a mansion for me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Water of life there floweth,
			Fruit in abundant store;
			Citizens of that country
			Hunger and thirst never more.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come go with me to homeland,
			Jesus invites you there;
			Help spread the invitation,
			Tell it to men everywhere.
		</verse>
