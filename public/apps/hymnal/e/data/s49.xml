	<verses>
		<verse>
			Savior, breathe an evening blessing,
			Ere repose our spirits seal;
			Sin and want we come confessing;
			Thou canst save, and Thou canst heal.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though the night be dark and dreary,
			Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
			Thou art He who, never weary,
			Watchest where Thy people be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though destruction walk around us,
			Though the arrow past us fly,
			Angel guards from Thee surround us,
			We are safe if Thou art nigh.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Should swift death this night o'er take us,
			And our couch become our tomb,
			May the morn of glory wake us,
			Clad in light and deathless bloom.
		</verse>
