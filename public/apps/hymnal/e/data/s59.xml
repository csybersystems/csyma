	<eTitle>Great Our Joy as Now We Gather</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Great our joy as now we gather
			Where the Master makes us one:
			Where we worship God the Father
			Thro' the Spirit of His Son.
			All who search for His church
			Find it where His will is done.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Precious is the tie that binds us
			To our God when faith grows cold;
			Precious all that now reminds us
			He is still our safe stronghold.
			Faithful love serves to prove
			Here the Shepherd has His fold.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May we learn from Christ's example
			How to use this house of prayer:
			He who loved and cleansed His temple
			Wants us all to worship there.
			God the Son shuts out none:
			In His Kingdom all may share.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, inspire us with Your vision
			Of a world which must be won!
			Glorious is the church's mission,
			Long endeavored, scarce begun!
			Faithful now- this is how
			God's eternal will is done.
		</verse>
