	<verses>
		<verse>
			What does the Lord require for praise and offering?
			What sacrifice, desire or tribute bid you bring?
			Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Rulers of men, give ear! Should you not justice show?
			Will God your pleading hear, while crime and cruelty grow?
			Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How shall our life fulfill God's law so hard and high?
			Let Christ endue our will with grace to fortify.
			Then justly, in mercy we'll humbly walk with God.
		</verse>
