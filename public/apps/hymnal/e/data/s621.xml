	<verses>
		<verse>
			Gracious Father, guard Thy children
			From the foe's destructive power;
			Save, O save them, Lord, from falling
			In this dark and trying hour.
			Thou wilt surely prove Thy people,
			All our graces must be tried;
			But Thy word illumes our pathway,
			And in God we still confide.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We are in the time of waiting;
			Soon we shall behold our Lord,
			Wafted far away from sorrow,
			To receive our rich reward.
			Keep us, Lord, till Thine appearing,
			Pure, unspotted from the world;
			Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us
			Till Thy banner is unfurled.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With what joyful exultation
			Shall the saints Thy banner see,
			When the Lord for whom we've waited
			Shall proclaim the jubilee!
			Freedom from this world's pollutions;
			Freedom from all sin and pain;
			Freedom from the wiles of Satan,
			And from death's destructive reign.
		</verse>
