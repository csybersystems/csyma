		<verse>
			God of our fathers, whose almighty hand
			Leads forth in beauty all the starry band
			Of shining world insplendor through the skies,
			Our grateful songs before Thy throne arise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thy love divine hath led us in the past,
			In this free land by Thee our lots is cast;
			Be Thou our ruler, guardian, guide, and stay,
			Thy word our law, Thy paths our chosen way.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			From war's alarms, from deadly pestilence,
			Be Thy strong arm our ever sure defense;
			Thy true religion in our hearts increase,
			Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Refresh Thy people on their toilsome way,
			Lead us from night to never-ending day;
			Fill all our lives with love and grace divine,
			And glory, laud, and praise be ever Thine.
		</verse>
