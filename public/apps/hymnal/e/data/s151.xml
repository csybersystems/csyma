	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
			He had to walk it by Himself.
			O nobody else could walk it for Him.
			He had to walk it by Himself.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I must go and stand my trial.
			I have to stand it by myself.
			O nobody else could stand it for me.
			I have to stand it by myself.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
			He had to walk it by Himself.
			O nobody else could walk it for Him.
			He had to walk it by Himself.
