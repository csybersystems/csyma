	<eTitle>THE BIRTH OF CHRIST -- Matthew 1 and Luke 2, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph,
			but before they came together,
			she was found to be with child
			through the Holy Spirit.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			An angel of the Lord appeared to
			him in a dream and said,
			"Joseph son of David,
			do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,
			because what is conceived in her 
			is from the Holy Spirit.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"She will give birth to a son,
			and you are to give him the name Jesus,
			because he will save his people
			from their sins."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And there were shepherds living 
			out in the fields nearby,
			keeping watch over their flocks	at night.
			An angel of the Lord appeared to them,
			and the glory of the Lord shone around them,
			and they were terrified.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But the angel said to them,
			"Do not be afraid.
			I bring you good news of great joy
			that will be for all the people.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Today in the town of David a Savior
			has been born to you;
			he is Christ the Lord.
			This will be a sign to you:
			You will find a baby wrapped in
			strips of cloth and lying in a manger."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host 
			appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
			"Glory to God in the highest,
			and on earth peace to men
			on whom his favor rests."
		</verse>
