		<verse>
			Thine is the glory, Risen, conquering Son;
			Endless is the victory thou o'er death hast won.
			Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,
			Kept the folded grave-clothes where Thy body lay.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Thine is the glory, Risen, conquering Son;
			Endless is the victory thou o'er death hast won.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Lo! Jesus meets us. Risen from the tomb,
			Lovingly He greets us, Scatters fear and gloom;
			Let His Church with gladness hymns of triumph sing,
			For her Lord now liveth; Death has lost its sting.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			No more we doubt Thee, Glorious Prince of life!
			Life is nought without Thee; Aid us in our strife;
			Make us more than conquerors through Thy deathless love
			Bring us safe through Jordan to Thy home above.
		</verse>
