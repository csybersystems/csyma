		<verse>
			All creatures of our God and King,
			Lift up your voice with us and sing:
			Alleluia! Alleluia!
			O burning sun with golden beam
			And silver moon with softer gleam:
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Oh, praise Him! Oh, praise Him!
			Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			O rushing wind and breezes soft,
			O clouds that ride the winds aloft:
			Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
			O rising morn, in praise rejoice,
			O lights of evening, find a voice.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O flowing waters, pure and clear,
			Make music for your Lord to hear.
			Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
			O fire so masterful and bright,
			Providing us with warmth and light,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let all things their Creator bless,
			And worship Him in humbleness,
			Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
			Oh, praise the Father, praise the Son,
			And praise the Spirit, three in One!
		</verse>
