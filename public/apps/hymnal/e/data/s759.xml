	<eTitle>BAPTISM -- John 3,1 Corinthians 12, Romans 6, and Matthew 28, RSV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
			unless one is born of water and the Spirit,
			he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			By one spirit we were all baptized
			into one body Jews or Greeks,
			slaves or free and all were made to drink
			of one Spirit.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Do you not know that all of us who
			have been baptized into Christ Jesus
			were baptized into his death?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We were buried therefore with him
			by baptism into death,
			so that as Christ was raised from the
			dead by the glory of the Father,
			we too might walk in newness of life.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For if we have been united with him
			in a death like his,
			we shall certainly be united with him
			in a resurrection like his.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We know that our old self was crucified with him
			so that the sinful body might be destroyed,
			and we might no longer be enslaved to sin.
			For he who has died is freed from sin.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
			baptizing them in the name of the
			Father and of the Son and of the
			Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe
			all that I have commanded you;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"and lo, I am with you always,
			to the close of the age."
		</verse>
