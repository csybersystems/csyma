	<eTitle>THE SABBATH-I -- Genesis 2, Colossians 1, Nehemiah 9, Exodus 20, and Mark 2, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Thus the heavens and the earth,
			and all the host of them, were finished.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And on the seventh day God ended His work
			which He had done,
			and He rested on the seventh day
			from all His work which He had done.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then God blessed the seventh day
			and sanctified it,
			because in it He rested from all His work
			which God had created and made.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			By [Christ] all things were created
			that are in heaven and that are on earth,
			visible and invisible, whether thrones
			or dominions or principalities or powers.
			All things were created through Him and for Him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You alone are the Lord;
			You have made heaven,
			The heaven of heavens,
			with all their host,
			The earth and all things on it,
			The seas and all that is in them,
			And You preserve them all.
			The host of heaven worships You....
			You made known to them Your holy Sabbath.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
			Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
			but the seventh day is the Sabbath
			of the Lord your God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"In it you shall do no work:
			you, nor your son, nor your daughter,
			nor your manservant, nor your maidservant,
			nor your cattle, nor your stranger
			who is within your gates.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"For in six days the Lord made the
			heavens and the earth, the sea,
			and all that is in them,
			and rested the seventh day.
			Therefore the Lord blessed the
			Sabbath day and hallowed it."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			[Jesus] said to them,
			"The Sabbath was made for man,
			and not man for the Sabbath.
			Therefore the Son of Man is also
			Lord of the Sabbath."
		</verse>
