	<verses>
		<verse>
			In Christ there is no east nor west,
			In Him no south or north;
			But one great fellowship of love
			Throughout the whole wide earth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In Him shall true hearts everywhere
			Their high communion find;
			His service is  the golden cord
			Close binding all mankind.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,
			Whate'er your race may be.
			Who serves my Father as a son
			Is surely kin to me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In Christ now meet both east and west,
			In Him meet south and north;
			All Christly souls are one in Him
			Throughout the whole wide earth.
		</verse>
