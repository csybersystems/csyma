	<verses>
		<verse>
			Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,
			Wheat that in dark earth many days has lain;
			Love lives again, that with the dead has been;
			Love is come again like wheat arising green.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the grave they laid Him, love by hatred slain,
			Thinking that He would never wake again,
			Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen;
			Love is come again like wheat arising green.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Forth He came in triumph, like the risen grain,
			He that for three days in the grave had lain;
			Raised from the dead, my living Lord is seen;
			Love is come again like wheat arising green.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,
			Your touch can call us back to life again,
			Fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been;
			Love is come again like wheat arising green
		</verse>
