	<eTitle>THE GOOD SHEPHERD -- John 10, Jerusalem</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			"I tell you most solemnly,
			anyone who does not enter the
			sheepfold through the gate,
			but gets in some other way
			is a thief and a brigand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The one who enters through the gate
			is the shepherd of the flock;
			the gatekeeper lets him in,
			the sheep hear his voice,
			one by one he calls his own sheep
			and leads them out.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"When he has brought out his flock,
			he goes ahead of them,
			and the sheep follow because they
			know his voice.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"They never follow a stranger
			but run away from him:
			they do not recognize the voice of strangers."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I tell you most solemnly,
			I am the gate of the sheepfold.
			All others who have come
			are thieves and brigands;
			but the sheep took no notice of them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I am the gate.
			Anyone who enters through me will be safe:
			he will go freely in and out 
			and be sure of finding pasture.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The thief comes only to steal and
			kill and destroy.
			I have come so that they may have life
			and have it to the full.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I am the good shepherd:
			the good shepherd is one who lays
			down his life for his sheep.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"The hired man, since he is not the shepherd
			and the sheep do not belong to him, 
			abandons the sheep and runs away 
			as soon as he sees a wolf coming, 
			and then the wolf attacks and
			scatters the sheep;
			this is because he is only a hired man
			and has no concern for the sheep.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I am the good shepherd;
			I know my own and my own know me,
			just as the Father knows me
			and I know the Father;
			and I lay down my life for my sheep.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"And there are other sheep I have 
			that are not of this fold,
			and these I have to lead as well.
			They too will listen to my voice,
			and there will be only one flock,
			and one shepherd."
