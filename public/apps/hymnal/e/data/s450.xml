	<verses>
		<verse>
			Beautiful Zion, built above,
			Beautiful city that I love,
			Beautiful gates of pearly white,
			Beautiful temple, God its light.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Beautiful trees forever there,
			Beautiful fruit they always bear,
			Beautiful rivers gliding by,
			Beautiful fountains never dry.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Beautiful crowns on every brow,
			Beautiful palms the conquerors show,
			Beautiful robes the ransomed wear,
			Beautiful all who enter there.
		</verse>
