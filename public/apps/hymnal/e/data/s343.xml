			Sing, Oh, sing (Sing, Oh sing) of my Redeemer,
			With His blood (With His blood) He purchased me;
			On the cross (On the cross) He sealed my pardon,
			Paid the debt (Paid the debt) and made me free. (made me free).
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I will sing of my Redeemer,
			And His wondrous love to me;
			On the cruel cross He suffered
			From the curse to set me free.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will tell the wondrous story,
			How my lost estate to save,
			In His boundless love and mercy,
			He the ransom freely gave.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will sing of my Redeemer,
			And His heav'nly love to me;
			He from death to life hath brought me,
			Son of God, with Him to be.
