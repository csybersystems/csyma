	<eTitle>O LORD, THOU ART MY GOD -- Isaiah 25, KJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			O Lord, thou art my God;
			I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name;
			for thou hast done wonderful things;
			thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou hast been a strength to the poor,
			a strength to the needy in his distress,
			a refuge from the storm,
			a shadow from the heat,
			when the blast of the terrible ones
			is as a storm against the wall.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He will swallow up death in victory;
			and the Lord God will wipe away
			tears from off all faces;
			and the rebuke of his people
			shall he take away from all the earth:
			for the Lord hath spoken it.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And it shall be said in that day,
			Lo, this is our God;
			we have waited for him,
			and he will save us: this is the Lord.
			we have waited for him,
			we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
		</verse>
