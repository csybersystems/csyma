	<eTitle>He Hideth My Soul</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<refrain>
			He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
			The shadows a dry, thirsty land;
			He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
			And covers me there with His hand,
			And covers me there with His hand.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
			A wonderful Savior to me,
			He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
			Where rivers of pleasure I see.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A wonderful Savior is Jesus my lord,
			He taketh my burden away,
			He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
			He giveth me strength as my day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
			And filled with His fullness divine,
			I sing in my rapture, Oh, glory to God
			For such a Redeemer as mine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
			To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
			His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
			I'll shout with the millions on high.
		</verse>
