	<eTitle>THE BODY OF CHRIST -- Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Just as each of us has one body with many members,
			and these members do not all have the same function,
			So in Christ we who are many form one body,
			and each member belongs to all the others.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We were all baptized by one Spirit into one body
			wbether Jews or Greeks, slave or free
			and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now the body is not made up of one part but of many....
			In fact God has arranged the parts in the body,
			everyone of them, just as he wanted them to be.
			If they were all one part, where would the body be?
			As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The eye cannot say to the band, "I don't need you!"
			And the bead cannot say to the feet,
			"I don't need you!"
			On the contrary, those parts of the
			body that seem to be weak, are indispensable
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There should be no division	in the body, but...
			its parts should have equal concern for each other.
			If one part suffers, every part suffers with it;
			if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now you are the body of Cbrist,
			and each one of you is a part of it.
		</verse>
