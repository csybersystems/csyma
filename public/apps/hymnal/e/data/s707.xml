	<verses>
		<verse>
			O praise the Lord.
			O praise God in his holy place,
			praise him in the vault of heaven,
			the vault of his power;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			praise him for his mighty works,
			praise him for his immeasurable greatness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise him with fanfares on the trumpet,
			praise him upon lute and harp;
			praise him with tambourines and dancing,
			praise him with flute and strings;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			praise him with the clash of cymbals,
			praise him with triumphant cymbals;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			let everything that has breath praise the Lord!
			O praise the Lord.
