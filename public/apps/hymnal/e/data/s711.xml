	<eTitle>PRAISE THE LORD, O MY SOUL -- Psalm 103, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Praise the Lord, 0 my soul;
			all my inmost being, praise his holy name.
			Praise the Lord, 0 my soul,
			and forget not all his benefits.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He forgives all my sins and heals all my diseases;
			he redeems my life from the pit
			and crowns me with love and compassion.
			He satisfies my desires with good things,
			so that my youth is renewed like the eagle's.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord is compassionate and gracious,
			slow to anger, abounding in love. . . . 
			He does not treat us as our sins deserve
			or repay us according to our iniquities.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
			so great is his love for those who fear him;
			as far as the east is from the west,
			so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise the Lord, 0 my soul.
		</verse>
