		<verse>
			I gave My life for thee,
			My precious blood I shed,
			That thou might'st ransomed be,
			And quickened from the dead;
			I gave, I gave My life for thee,
			What hast thou given for Me?
			I gave, I gave My life for thee,
			What hast thou given for Me?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My Father's house of light,
			My glory circled throne,
			I left for earthly night,
			For wanderings sad and lone;
			I left, I left it all for thee,
			Hast thou left aught for Me?
			I left, I left it all for thee,
			Hast thou left aught for Me?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I suffered much for thee,
			More than thy tongue can tell,
			Of bitterest agony,
			To rescue thee from hell;
			I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
			What hast thou borne for Me?
			I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
			What hast thou borne for Me?
		</verse>
