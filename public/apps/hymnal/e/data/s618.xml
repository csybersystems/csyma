	<verses>
		<verse>
			Stand up, stand up for Jesus, ye soldiers of the cross;
			Lift high his royal banner, it must not suffer loss.
			From victory unto victory his army shall he lead,
			Till every foe is vanquished, and Christ is Lord indeed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Stand up, stand up for Jesus, the trumpet call obey;
			Forth to the mighty conflict, in this His glorious day.
			Ye that are His now serve Him against unnumbered foes;
			Let courage rise with danger, and strength to strength oppose.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Stand up, stand up for Jesus, stand in his strength alone;
			The arm of flesh will fail you, ye dare not trust your own.
			Put on the gospel armor, and, watching unto prayer;
			Where duty calls, or danger, be never wanting there.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Stand up, stand up for Jesus, the strife will not be long;
			This day the noise of battle, the next the victor's song.
			To him that overcometh, a crown of life shall be;
			He with the King of Glory shall reign eternally.
		</verse>
