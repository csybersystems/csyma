	<eTitle>On Jordan's Stormy Banks</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<refrain>
			I am bound for the promised land,
			I am bound  for the promised land;
			O who will come and go with me?
			I am bound for the promised land.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
			And cast a wishful eye
			To Canaan's fair and happy land,
			Where my possessions lie.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O'er all those wide extended plain
			Shines one eternal day;
			There, Christ, the Sun, for ever reigns,
			And scatters night away.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When shall I reach that happy place,
			And be forever blest?
			When shall I see my Father's face,
			And in His kingdom rest?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Filled with delight, my raptured soul
			Would here no longer stay;
			Though Jordan's waves around me roll,
			Fearless I'd launch away.
		</verse>
