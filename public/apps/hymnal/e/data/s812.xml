	<verses>
		<verse>
			You are God's chosen race, his saints;
			he loves you, and you should be clothed
			in sincere compassion, in kindness
			and humility, gentleness and patience.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Bear with one another; forgive each
			other as soon as a quarrel begins.
			The Lord has forgiven you;
			now you must do the same.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Over all these clothes,
			to keep them together and complete them, put on love.
			And may the peace of Christ reign in your hearts,
			because it is for this that you were called 
			together as parts of one body.
			Always be thankful.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let the message of Christ, in all its richness,
			find a home with you. Teach each other,
			and advise each other, in all wisdom.
			With gratitude in your hearts sing psalms
			and hymns and inspired songs to God;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			and never say or do anything except in
			the name of the Lord Jesus,
			giving thanks to God the Father through him.*
		</verse>
