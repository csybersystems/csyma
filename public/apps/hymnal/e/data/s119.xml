		<verse>
			Angels from the realms of glory,
			Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
			Ye who sang creation's story
			Now proclaim Messiah's birth
			Come and worship, come and worship,
			Worship Christ, the newborn king.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Shepherds, in the field abiding,
			Watching o'er your flocks by night,
			God with us is now residing;
			Yonder shines the infant light
			Come and worship, come and worship,
			Worship Christ, the newborn king.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sages, leave your contemplations,
			Brighter visions beam afar;
			Seek the great Desire of nations;
			Ye have seen his natal star
			Come and worship, come and worship,
			Worship Christ, the newborn king.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Saints, before the altar bending,
			Watching long in hope and fear;
			Suddenly the Lord, descending,
			In his temple shall appear.
			Come and worship, come and worship,
			Worship Christ, the newborn king.
		</verse>
