	<eTitle>BLESSED IS HE WHOSE TRANSGRESSIONS ARE FORGIVEN -- Psalm 32, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Blessed is he whose transgressions
			are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
			Blessed is the man whose sin the
			Lord does not count against him
			and in whose spirit is no deceit.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When I kept silent, my bones wasted
			away through my groaning all day long.
			For day and night your hand was heavy upon me;
			my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then I acknowledged my sin to you
			and did not cover up my iniquity.
			I said, "I will confess my transgressions
			to the Lord" and you forgave the guilt of my sin.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore let everyone who is godly
			pray to you while you may be found;
			surely when the mighty waters rise,
			they will not reach him.
			You are my hiding place; you will protect me
			from trouble and surround me with
			songs of deliverance.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will instruct you and teach you
			in the way you should go;
			I will counsel you and watch over you.
		</verse>
