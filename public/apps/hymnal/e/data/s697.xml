	<eTitle>SHOUT WITH JOY TO GOD, ALL THE EARTH! -- Psalm 66, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Shout with joy to God, all the earth!
			Sing to the glory of his name;
			offer him glory and praise!
			Praise our God, 0 peoples,
			let the sound of his praise be heard;
			he has preserved our lives
			and kept our feet from slipping.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For you, 0 God, tested us;
			you refined us like silver. 
			You brought us into prison 
			and laid burdens on our backs.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You let men ride over our heads;
			we went through fire and water, 
			but you brought us to a place of abundance.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will come to your temple with
			burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you 
			vows my lips promised and my
			mouth spoke when I was in trouble.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come and listen, all you who fear God;
			let me tell you what he has done for me. 
			I cried out to him with my mouth; 
			his praise was on my tongue.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If I had cherished sin in my heart,
			the Lord would not have listened;
			but God has surely listened
			and heard my voice in prayer.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer
			or withheld his love from me!
		</verse>
