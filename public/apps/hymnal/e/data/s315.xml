	<verses>
		<verse>
			O, for a closer walk with God!
			A calm and heavenly frame,
			A light to shine upon the road
			That leads me to the Lamb.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Return, O holy Dove! return,
			Sweet messenger of rest;
			I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,
			And drove Thee from my breast.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
			How sweet their memory still!
			But they have left an aching void
			The world can never fill.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The dearest idol I have known,
			What-e'er that idol be,
			Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
			And worship only Thee.
		</verse>
