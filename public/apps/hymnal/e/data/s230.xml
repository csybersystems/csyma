		<verse>
			All glory, laud, and honor
			To Thee, Redeemer, King,
			To whom the lips of children
			Made sweet hosannas ring.
			Thou art the King of Israel
			Thou David's royal Son,
			Who in the Lord's name comest,
			The King and Blessed One.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The company of angels
			Are praising thee on high,
			And mortal men and all things
			Created make reply
			The people of the Hebrews
			With psalms before thee went;
			Our praise and prayer anthems
			Before thee we present.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To thee, before thy passion,
			They sang their hymns of praise;
			To thee, now high exalted,
			Our melody we raise.
			Thou didst accept their praises;
			Accept the prayers we bring,
			Who in all good delightest,
			Thou good and gracious King.
		</verse>
