	<verses>
		<verse>
			Now let us from this table rise
			Renewed in body, mind, and soul;
			With Christ we die and live again,
			His selfless love has made us whole.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With minds alert, upheld by grace,
			To spread the word in speech and deed,
			We follow in the steps of Christ,
			At one with all in hope and need.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To fill each human house with love,
			It is the sacrament of care;
			The work that Christ began to do
			We humbly pledge ourselves to share.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then grant us courage, Father God,
			To choose again the pilgrim way
			And help us to accept with joy
			The challenge of tomorrow's day.
		</verse>
