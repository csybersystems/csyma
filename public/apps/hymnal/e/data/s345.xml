	<verses>
		<verse>
			Christ is the world's true light,
			Its captain of salvation,
			The daystar clear and bright
			Of every man and nation;
			New life, new hope awakes
			Where'er men own His sway:
			Freedom her bondage breaks,
			And night is turned to day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In Christ all races meet,
			Their ancient feuds forgeting,
			The whole round world complete,
			From sunrise to its setting:
			When Christ is throned as Lord,
			Men shall forsake their fear,
			To plowshare beat the sword,
			To pruning hook the spear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			One Lord, in one great name
			Unite us all who own Thee,
			Cast out our pride and shame
			That hinder to enthrone Thee;
			The world has waited long,
			Has travailed long in pain,
			To heal its ancient wrong,
			Come, Prince of Peace, and reign.
		</verse>
