		<verse>
			Children of the heavenly Father
			Safely in His bossom gather;
			Nestling bird nor star in heaven
			Such a refuge e'er was given.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God His own doth tend and nourish,
			In His holy love they flourish;
			From all evil things He spares them,
			In His mighty arms He bears them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Neither life nor death shall ever
			From the Lord His children sever;
			Unto them His grace He showeth,
			And their sorrows all He knoweth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,
			Your Protector never slumbers;
			At the will of your Defender
			Every foe-man must surrender.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though He giveth or He taketh,
			God His children ne'er forsaketh;
			His the loving purpose solely
			To preserve them pure and holy.
		</verse>
