	<eTitle>THE PATH OF LIFE -- Psalm 16, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			You, 0 Lord, are the portion of my
			inheritance and my cup;
			You maintain my lot.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places;
			Yes, I have a good inheritance.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will bless the Lord who has given me counsel;
			My heart also instructs me in the night seasons.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I have set the Lord always before me;
			Because He is at my right hand I shall not be moved.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices;
			My flesh also will rest in hope.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For You will not leave my soul in Sheol,*
			Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You will show me the path of life;
			In Your presence is fullness of joy;
			At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
		</verse>
