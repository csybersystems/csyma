	<eTitle>OUR ATONING JUDGE -- Romans 14 and 1 John 2, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Why do you judge your brother?
			Or why do you look down on your brother?
			For we will all stand before God's
			judgment seat.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It is written:
			"'As surely as I live,' says the Lord,
			'Every knee will bow before me;
			every tongue will confess to God.'"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So then, each of us will give an
			account of himself to God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My dear children, I write this to you
			so that you will not sin.
			But if anybody does sin,
			we have one who speaks to the Father
			in our defenseâ€”Jesus Christ,
			the Righteous One.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins,
			and not only for ours but also for
			the sins of the whole world.
		</verse>
