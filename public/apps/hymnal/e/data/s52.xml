		<verse>
			Now the day is over,
			Night is drawing nigh,
			Shadows of the evening
			Steal across the sky.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Father, give the weary
			Calm and sweet repose;
			With Thy tenderest blessing
			May our eyelids close.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Through the long night watches,
			May Thine angels spread
			Their white wings above me,
			Watching round my bed.
		</verse>
