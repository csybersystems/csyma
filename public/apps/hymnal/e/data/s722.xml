	<eTitle>HE THAT DWELLETH IN THE SECRET PLACE -- Psalm 91, KJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			He that dwelleth in the secret place
			of the most High
			shall abide under the shadow
			of the Almighty.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will say of the Lord,
			He is my refuge and my fortress:
			my God; in him will I trust.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Surely he shall deliver thee
			from the snare of the fowler,
			and from the noisome pestilence.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He shall cover thee with his feathers,
			and under his wings shalt thou trust:
			his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night;
			nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
			nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness;
			nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A thousand shall fall at thy side,
			and ten thousand at thy right hand;
			but it shall not come nigh thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see
			the reward of the wicked.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Because thou hast made the Lord,
			which is my refuge,
			even the most High, thy habitation;
			there shall no evil befall thee,
			neither shall any plague
			come nigh thy dwelling.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For he shall give his angels charge over thee,
			to keep thee in all thy ways.
		</verse>
