			Spirit divine, attend our prayers,
			And make this house Thy home;
			Descend with all Thy gracious powers,
			O come, great Spirit, come!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come as the light; to us reveal
			Our emptiness and woe,
			And lead us in those paths of life
			Where-on the righteous go.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come as the fire, and purge our hearts
			Like sacrificial flame;
			Let our whole soul an of - f'ring be
			To our Redeemer's name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come as the dove, and spread Thy wings,
			The wings of peaceful love;
			And let Thy church on earth become
			Blest as the church above.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Spirit divine, attend our prayers,
			Make a lost world Thy home;
			Descend with all Thy gracious powers,
			O come, great Spirit, come!
