		<verse>
			The God of Abraham praise,
			Who reigns enthroned above;
			Ancient of everlasting days,
			And God of love;
			Jehovah! Great I AM!
			By earth and heaven confessed;
			I bow and bless the sacred name,
			Forever blest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The God of Abraham praise,
			At whose supreme command
			From earth I rise, and seek the joys
			At His right hand;
			I all on earth forsake,
			Its wisdom, fame and power;
			And Him my only portion make,
			My shield and tower.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The whole triumphant host
			Give thanks to God on high;
			"Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!"
			They ever cry;
			Hail, Abraham's God and mine!
			I join the heavenly lays;
			All might and majesty are Thine,
			And endless praise.
		</verse>
