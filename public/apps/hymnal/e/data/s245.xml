	<verses>
		<verse>
			More about Jesus I would know,
			More of His grace to others show;
			More of His saving fullness see,
			More of His love who died for me.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			More, more about Jesus,
			More, more about Jesusl;
			More of His saving fullness see,
			More of His love who died for me.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			More about Jesus let me learn,
			More of His holy will discern;
			Spirit of God, my teacher be,
			Showing the things of Christ to me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			More about Jesus; in His word,
			Holding commuion with my Lord,
			Hearing His voice in every line,
			Making each faithful saying mine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			More about Jesus; on His throne,
			Riches in glory all His own;
			More of His kingdom's sure increase;
			More of His coming, Prince of Peace.
		</verse>
