		<verse>
			There is a green hill far away,
			Without a city wall,
			Where the dear Lord was crucified,
			Who died to save us all.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We may not know, we cannot tell,
			What pains He had to bear,
			But we believe it was for us
			He hung and suffered there.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He died that we might be forgiven,
			He died to make us good,
			That we might go at last to heaven,
			Saved by His precious blood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There was no other good enough
			To pay the price of sin;
			He only could unlock the gate
			Of heaven, and let us in.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O dearly, dearly has He loved!
			And we must love Him too,
			And trust in His redeeming blood,
			And try His works to do.
		</verse>
