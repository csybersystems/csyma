		<verse>
			"There shall be showers of blessing;"
			This is the promise of love;
			There shall be seasons refreshing,
			Sent from the Savior above.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Showers of blessing,
			Showers of blessing we need;
			Mercy drops round us are falling,
			But for the showers we plead.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			"There shall be showers of blessing;"
			Precious reviving again;
			Over the hills and the valleys,
			Sound of abundance of rain.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"There shall be showers of blessing;"
			Send them upon us, O Lord;
			Grant to us now a refreshing;
			Come, and now honor Thy word.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"There shall be showers of blessing;"
			O that today they might fall,
			Now as to God were confessing,
			Now as on Jesus we call!
		</verse>
