	<verses>
		<verse>
			Father, help Your people in this world to build
			Something of Your kingdom and to do Your will,
			Lead us to discover partnership in love;
			Bless our ways of sharing and our pride remove.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord of desk and altar, bind our lives in one,
			That in work and worship love may set the tone.
			Give us grace to listen, clarity of speech;
			Make us truly thankful for the gifts of each.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy is the setting of each room and yard,
			Lecture hall and kitchen, office, shop, and ward.
			Holy is the rhythm of our working hours;
			Hallow then our purpose, energy, and pow'rs.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Strengthen, Lord, for service hand and heart and brain;
			Help us good relations daily to maintain.
			Let the living presence of the servant Christ
			Heighten our devotion, make our life a feast.
		</verse>
