	<verses>
		<verse>
			The homeland! O the homeland!
			The land of the free born!
			There's no night in the homeland,
			But aye the fadeless morn;
			I'm sighing for homeland,
			My heart is aching here;
			There is no pain in the homeland
			To which I'm drawing near;
			There is no pain in the homeland
			To which I'm drawing near.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My Lord is in the homeland,
			With angels bright and fair;
			There's no sin in the homeland,
			And no temptation there;
			The music of the homeland
			Is ringing in my ears;
			And when I think of the homeland
			My eyes are filled with tears;
			And when I think of the homeland
			My  ears are filled with tears.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The dwellers in the homeland
			Are beckoning me to come,
			Where neither death nor sorrow
			Invades their holy name;
			O dear, dear native country!
			O rest  and  peace above!
			Christ bring us all to the homeland
			Of Thy redeeming love;
			Christ bring us all to the homeland
			Of  Thy redeeming love
		</verse>
