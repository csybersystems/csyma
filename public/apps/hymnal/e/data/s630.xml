	<verses>
		<verse>
			Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
			Thy better portion trace;
			Rise from transitory things
			Toward heaven, thy native place:
			Sun, and moon, and stars decay;
			Time shall soon this earth remove;
			Rise, my soul, and haste away
			To seats prepared above.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Rivers to the ocean run,
			Nor stay in all their course;
			Fire ascending seeks the sun;
			Both speed them to their source;
			So a soul that's born of God,
			Longs to view His glorious face,
			Forward tends to His abode
			To rest in His embrace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn;
			Press onward to the prize;
			Soon our Savior will return,
			Triumphant in the skies;
			Yet a season, and you know
			Happy entrance will be given,
			All our sorrows left below,
			And earth exchanged for heaven.
		</verse>
