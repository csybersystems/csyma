		<verse>
			The Lord's my Shepherd; I'll not want.
			He makes me down to lie
			In pastures green; He leadeth me
			The quiet waters by.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My soul He doth restore again,
			And me to walk doth make
			Within the paths of righteousness,
			E'en for His own name's sake.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
			Yet will I fear on ill;
			For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
			And staff me comfort still.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My table thou has furnished
			In presence of my foes;
			My  head Thou dost with oil anoint,
			And my cup overflows.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Goodness and mercy all my life
			Shall surely follow me,
			And in God's house forevermore
			My dwelling place shall be.
		</verse>
