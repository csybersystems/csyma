	<eTitle>HAPPY ARE ALL WHO FEAR THE LORD -- Psalm 128, NEB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Happy are all who fear the Lord,
			who live according to his will.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You shall eat the fruit of your own labours,
			you shall be happy and you shall prosper.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine
			in the heart of your house;
			your sons* shall be like olive-shoots
			round about your table.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This is the blessing in store for the
			man who fears the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May the Lord bless you from Zion;
			may you share the prosperity of Jerusalem
			all the days of your life,
			and live to see your children's children!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Peace be upon Israel!
		</verse>
