		<verse>
			Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
			The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.
			The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,
			The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
			But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes.
			I love Thee, Lord Jesus! look down from the sky,
			And stay by my side till the morning is nigh.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask Thee to stay
			Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
			Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,
			And fit us for heaven, to live with Thee there.
