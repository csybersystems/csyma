	<verses>
		<verse>
			Hover o'er me, Holy Spirit,
			Bathe my trembling heart and brow;
			Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
			Come, O come and fill me now.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Fill me now, fill me now,
			Jesus, come and fill me now.
			Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
			Come, O come and fill me now.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,
			Though I cannot tell Thee how;
			But I need Thee, greatly need Thee;
			Come, O come and fill me now.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I am weakness, full of weakness;
			At Thy sacred feet I bow;
			Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
			Fill with love, and fill me now.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;
			Bathe, O, bathe my heart and brow;
			Thou art comforting and saving,
			Thou art sweetly filling now.
		</verse>
