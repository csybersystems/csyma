		<refrain>
			Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
			Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
			Anywhere He leads me in this world below; 
			Anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade;
			Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
			Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
			Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
			Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
			When the gloomy shadows round about me creep,
			Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
			Anywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home.
		</verse>
