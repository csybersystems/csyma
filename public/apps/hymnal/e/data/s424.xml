	<eTitle>For Thee, O Dear, Dear Country</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			For thee, O dear country,
			Mine eyes their vigils keep;
			For very love beholding
			Thy holy name, they weep.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O one, O only mansion!
			O Paradise of joy!
			Where tears are ever banish'd
			And smiles have no alloy;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With jasper glow thy burwarks,
			Thy streets with emeralds blaze;
			The sardius and the topaz
			Unite in thee  their rays;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The cross is all thy splendor,
			The Crucified thy praise;
			His laud and benediction
			Thy ransom'd saints shall raise;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O sweet and blessed country,
			The home of God's elect!
			O sweet and blessed country
			That eager hearts expect!
		</verse>
