		<verse>
			Fire of God, Thou sacred flame,
			Spirit who in splendor came,
			Let Thy heat my soul refine
			Till it glows with love divine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Breath of God, that swept in power
			In the pentecostal hour,
			Holy Breath, be Thou in me
			Source of vital energy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Strength of God, Thy might within
			Conquers sorrow, pain, and sin:
			Fortify from evil's art
			All the gateways of my heart.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Truth of God, Thy piercing rays
			Penetrate my secret ways.
			May the light that shames my sin
			Guide me holier paths to win.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Love of God, Thy grace profound
			Knoweth neither age nor bound:
			Come, my heart's own guest to be,
			Dwell forevermore in me.
		</verse>
