	<verses>
		<verse>
			Oh, the depth of the riches
			of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How unsearchable his judgments,
			and his paths beyond tracing out!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Who has known the mind of the Lord?
			Or who has been his counselor?"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Who has ever given to God,
			that God should repay him?"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For from him and through him
			and to him are all things.
			To him be the glory forever! Amen.
