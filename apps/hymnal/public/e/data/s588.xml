		<verse>
			Lord of all nations, grant me grace
			To love all people, every race,
			And in each person may I see
			My kindred loved, redeemed by Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Break down the wall that would divide
			Thy children Lord, on every side.
			My neighbor's good let me pursue;
			Let Christian love bind warm and true.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Forgive me, Lord, where I have erred
			By loveless act and thoughtless word.
			Make me to see the wrong I do
			Will crucify my Lord anew.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Give me Thy courage, Lord, to speak
			Whenever strong oppress the weak.
			Should I myself the victim be,
			Help me forgive, rememb'ring Thee
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With Thine own love may I be filled
			And by Thy Holy Spirit willed,
			That all I touch, where'er I be,
			May be divinely touched by Thee.
		</verse>
