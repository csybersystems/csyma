	<verses>
		<verse>
			Christ upon the mountain peak
			Stands alone in glory blazing;
			Let us, if we dare to speak,
			With the saints and angels praise Him:
			Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Trembling at His feet we saw
			Moses and Elijah speaking;
			All the prophets and the law
			Shout thro'them their joyful greeting:
			Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Swift the cloud of glory came,
			God proclaiming in the thunder
			Jesus as His Son by name;
			Nations cry aloud in wonder!
			Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This is God's beloved Son:
			Law and prophets fade before Him;
			First and last, the only One,
			Let creation now adore Him.
			Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
		</verse>
