		<verse>
			What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul?
			What wondrous love is this,
			O my soul? What wondrous love is this
			That caused the Lord of bliss
			To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul;
			To bear the dreadful curse for my soul
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To God and to the Lamb I will sing,
			I will sing; To God and to the Lamb,
			I will sing; To God and to the Lamb
			Who is the great I am, While millions join the theme,
			I will sing, I will sing; While millions join the theme, I will sing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on, I'll sing on;
			And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on;
			And when from death I'm free,
			I'll sing and joyful be, And through eternity
			I'll sing on, I'll sing on! And through eternity, I'll sing on
		</verse>
