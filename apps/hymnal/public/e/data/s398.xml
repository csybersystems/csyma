		<verse>
			Bread of the world in mercy broken,
			Wine of the soul in mercy shed,
			By whom the words of life are spoken,
			And in whose death our sins are dead;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Look on the heart by sorrow broken,
			Look on the tears by sinners shed;
			And be Thy feast to us the token
			That by Thy grace our souls are fed. Amen.
		</verse>
