		<verse>
			Praise we the Lord, who made all beauty
			For all our senses to enjoy;
			Owe we our humble thanks and duty
			That simple pleasures never cloy;
			Praise we the Lord, who made all beauty
			For all our senses to enjoy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise Him who loves to see young lovers,
			Fresh hearts that swell with youthful pride;
			Thank Him who sends the sun above us,
			As bridegroom fit to meet his bride;
			Praise Him who loves to see young lovers,
			Fresh hearts that swell with youthful pride.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise Him who by a simple flower
			Lifts up our hearts to things above;
			Thank Him who gives to each one power
			To find a friend to know and love;
			Praise Him who by a simple flower
			Lifts up our hearts to things above.
