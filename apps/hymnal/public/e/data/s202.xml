		<verse>
			Tell it to every kindred and nation,
			Tell it far and near;
			Earth's darkest night will fade with the dawning,
			Jesus will soon appear.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Hail Him the King of glory,
			Once the Lamb for sinners slain;
			Tell, tell the wondrous story,
			"Jesus comes to reign."
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Nations again in strife and commotion,
			Warnings by the way;
			Signs in the heavens, unerring omens,
			Herald the glorious day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Children of God look up with rejoicing;
			Shout and sing His praise;
			Blessed are they who, waiting and watching,
			Look for the dawning rays.
		</verse>
