	<verses>
		<verse>
			In the cross of Christ I glory,
			towering o'er the wrecks of time;
			all the light of sacred story
			gathers round its head sublime.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When the woes of life o'ertake me,
			hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
			never shall the cross forsake me.
			Lo! it glows with peace and joy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When the sun of bliss is beaming
			light and love upon my way,
			from the cross the radiance streaming
			adds more luster to the day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
			by the cross are sanctified;
			peace is there that knows no measure,
			joys that through all time abide.
		</verse>
