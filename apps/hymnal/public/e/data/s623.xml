		<refrain>
			I will follow Thee, my Saviour,
			Thou didst shed Thy blood for me;
			And though all men should forsake Thee;
			By Thy grace I'll follow Thee.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I will follow Thee, my Savior,
			Wheresoe'er my lot may be.
			Where thou goest I will follow; 
			Yes, my Lord, I'll follow Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though the road be rough and thorny,
			Trackless as the foaming sea,
			Thou hast trod this way before me, 
			And I'll gladly follow Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though I meet with tribulations,
			Sorely tempted though I be;
			I remember Thou wast tempted,
			And rejoice to follow Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though Thou leadest me through affliction,
			Poor, forsaken though I be;
			Thou wast destitute, afflicted,
			And I only follow Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though to Jordan's rolling billows,
			Cold and deep, Thou leadest me,
			Thou hast crossed the waves before me,
			And I still will follow Thee.
