		<verse>
			Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
			Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
			Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,
			Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
			I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord;
			Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
			Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,
			Thou my Inheritance, now and always:
			Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
			High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			High King of heaven, my vict'ry is won,
			May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
			Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
			Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
		</verse>
