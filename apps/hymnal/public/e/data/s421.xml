		<verse>
			For all the saints, who from their labors rest,
			who thee by faith before the world confessed,
			thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.
			Alleluia, Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou wast their rock, their fortress, and their might;
			thou Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;
			thou in the darkness drear, their one true light.
			Alleluia, Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O may thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,
			fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
			and win with them the victor's crown of gold.
			Alleluia, Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O blest communion, fellowship divine!
			We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
			yet all are one in thee, for all are thine.
			Alleluia, Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
			steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
			and hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.
			Alleluia, Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,
			through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
			singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:
			Alleluia, Alleluia!
		</verse>
