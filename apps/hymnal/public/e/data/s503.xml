		<verse>
			There is a quiet place,
			Far from the rapid pace where
			God can soothe my troubled mind.
			Sheltered by tree and flow'r,
			There in my quiet hour with Him
			My cares are left behind.
			Whether a garden small,
			Or on a mountain tall,
			New strength and courage there I find;
			Then from this quiet place
			I go prepared to face a new day
			With love for all mankind.
