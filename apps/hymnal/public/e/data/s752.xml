	<verses>
		<verse>
			"I will pray the Father,
			and he will give you another Counselor,
			to be with you for ever,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"even the Spirit of truth,
			whom the world cannot receive,
			because it neither sees him nor knows him;
			you know him, for he dwells with you,
			and will be in you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I will not leave you desolate;
			I will come to you."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Nevertheless I tell you the truth:
			it is to your advantage that I go away,
			for if I do not go away,
			the Counselor will not come to you;
			but if I go, I will send him to you.
			"And when he comes, he will	convince
			the world concerning sin and
			righteousness and judgment:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"concerning sin, because they do
			not believe in me; concerning righteousness,
			because I go to the Father,
			and you will see me no more;
			concerning judgment,
			because the ruler of this world is judged."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"When the Spirit of truth comes, 
			he will guide you into all the truth;
			for he will not speak on his own authority,
			but whatever he hears he will speak,
			and he will declare to you
			the things that are to come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"He will glorify me,
			for he will take what is mine
			and declare it to you."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"But when the Counselor comes,
			whom I shall send to you from the Father,...
			he will bear witness to me."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit,
			whom the Father will send in my name,
			be will teach you all things,
			and bring to your remembrance
			all that I have said to you."
