	<verses>
		<verse>
			"Father, the time has come.
			Glorify your Son,
			that your Son may glorify you."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Now this is eternal life:
			that they may know you, the only true God,
			and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I have revealed you to those
			whom you gave me out of the world.
			They were yours; you gave them to me
			and they have obeyed your word."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I pray for them.
			I am not praying for the world,
			but for those you have given me, for
			they are yours....
			Glory has come to me through them."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Holy Father, protect them
			by the power of your name--
			the name you gave me--
			so that they may be one as we are one."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I am coming to you now,
			but I say these things
			while I am still in the world,
			so that they may have the full 
			measure of my joy within them."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"My prayer is not that you take them
			out of the world but that you protect them
			from the evil one.
			They are not of the world,
			even as 1 am not of it.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Sanctify them by the truth;
			your word is truth.
			As you sent me into the world,
			I have sent them into the world.
			For them I sanctify myself,
			that they too may be truly sanctified.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"My prayer is not for them alone.
			I pray also for those who will believe
			in me through their message,
			that all of them may be one, Father,
			just as you are in me and 1 am in you."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"May they be brought to complete unity
			to let the world know that you sent me
			and have loved them even as you have loved me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Father, 1 want those you have given me
			to be with me where 1 am, and to see my glory,
			the glory you have given me because you loved me
			before the creation of the world."
		</verse>
