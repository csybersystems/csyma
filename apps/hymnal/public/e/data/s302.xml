		<verse>
			In the blood from the cross
			I have been washed from sin;
			But to be free from dross,
			Still I would enter in.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Deeper yet, deeper yet,
			Into the crimson flood;
			Deeper yet, deeper yet,
			Under the precious blood.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Day by day, hour by hour,
			Blessings are sent to me;
			But for more of His power
			Ever my prayer shall be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Near to Christ I would live,
			Following Him each day;
			What I ask He will give;
			So then with faith I pray.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now I have peace, sweet peace,
			While in this world of sin;
			But to pray I'll not cease
			Till I am pure within.
		</verse>
