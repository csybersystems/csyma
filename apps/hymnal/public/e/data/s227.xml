	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus shall reign where e'r the sun
			Does its successive journeys run;
			His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
			Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			People and realms of every tongue
			Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
			And infant voices shall proclaim
			Their earthly blessings on His name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Blessings abound where e'r He reigns:
			The pris- 'ners leap to lose their chains,
			The weary find eternal rest,
			And all who suffer want are blest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let every creature rise and bring
			Honors peculiar to our King;
			Angels descend with songs again,
			And earth repeat the loud amen.
		</verse>
