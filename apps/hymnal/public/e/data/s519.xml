		<verse>
			Give to the winds your fears;
			In hope be an dismayed;
			God hears your sighs and counts your tears;
			God shall lift up thy head.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To Him commit your griefs
			Your ways put in His hands-
			To His sure truth and tender care
			Who earth and heaven commands
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O put your trust in God;
			In duties path go on.
			Walk in his strength with faith and hope,
			So shall your work be done.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Leave to His soveriegn sway
			To choose and to command
			So you shall, faithful, seek in His way
			How wise, how strong his hand!
		</verse>
