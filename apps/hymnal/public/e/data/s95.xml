	<verses>
		<verse>
			Spring has now unwrapped the flowers,
			Day is fast reviving,
			Life in all her growing powers
			Towards the light is striving:
			Gone the iron touch of cold,
			Winter time and frost time,
			Seedlings, working through the mould,
			Now make up for lost time.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Herb and plant that winter long,
			Slumbered at their leisure,
			Now be stirring, green and strong,
			Find in growth their pleasure:
			All the world with beauty fills,
			Gold the green enhacing;
			Flowers make glee among the hills,
			Set the meadows dancing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Through each wonder of fair days
			God Himself expresses;
			Beauty follows all His ways,
			As the world He blesses:
			So, as He renews the earth,
			Artist without rival,
			In His grace of glad new birth
			We must seek revival.
		</verse>
