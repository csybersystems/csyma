			There'll be no sorrow there,
			There'll be no sorrow there;
			In heaven above, where all is love,
			There'll be no sorrow there.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			There'll be no night in heaven,
			In that blest world above;
			No anxious toil, no weary hours;
			For labor there is love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There'll be no grief in heaven;
			For life is one glad day,
			And tears are those of former things
			Which all have passed away.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There'll be no sin in heaven;
			Behold that blessed throng,
			All holy in there spotless robes,
			All holy in their  song.
