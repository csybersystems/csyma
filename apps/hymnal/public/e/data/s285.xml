	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus calls us o'er the tumult
			of our life's wild, restless sea;
			day by day his sweet voice soundeth,
			saying, "Christian, follow me!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus calls us from the worship
			of the vain world's golden store,
			from each idol that would keep us,
			saying, "Christian, love me more!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In our joys and in our sorrows,
			days of toil and hours of ease,
			still he calls, in cares and pleasures,
			"Christian, love me more than these!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus calls us! By thy mercies,
			Savior, may we hear thy call,
			give our hearts to thine obedience,
			serve and love thee best of all.
		</verse>
