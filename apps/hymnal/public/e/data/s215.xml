	<verses>
		<verse>
			The King shall come when morning dawns
			And light triumphant breaks,
			When beauty gilds the eastern hills
			And life to joy awakes.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Not as of old a little child,
			To bear and fight and die,
			But crowned with glory like the sun
			That lights the morning sky.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O, brighter than the rising morn
			When Christ, victorious, rose
			And left the lonesome place of death,
			Despite the rage of foes.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O, brighter than that glorious morn
			Shall dawn upon our race
			The day when Christ in splendor comes,
			And we shall see His face.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The King shall come when morning dawns
			And light and beauty brings.
			Hail, Christ the Lord! Your people pray:
			Come quickly, King of kings.
		</verse>
