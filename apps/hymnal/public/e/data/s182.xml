	<verses>
		<verse>
			Christ is alive! Let Christians sing.
			His cross stands empty to the sky.
			Let streets and homes with praises ring.
			His love in death shall never die.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Christ is alive! No longer bound
			To distant years in Palestine,
			He comes to claim the here and now
			And conquer every place and time.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In every insult, rift, and war
			Where color, scorn or wealth divide,
			He suffers still, yet loves the more,
			And lives, though ever crucified.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Christ is alive! Ascended Lord
			He rules the world His Father made,
			Till, in the end, His love adored
			Shall be to all on earth displayed.
		</verse>
