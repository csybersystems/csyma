	<verses>
		<verse>
			An upper room did our Lord prepare
			For those loved until the end:
			And His disciples still gather there,
			To celebrate their risen Friend.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And after supper He washed their feet,
			For service, too, is sacrament.
			In Him our joy shall be made complete
			Sent out to serve, as He was sent.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A lasting gift Jesus gave His own:
			To share His bread, His loving cup.
			Whatever burdens may bow us down,
			He by His cross shall lift us up.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			No end there is! we depart in peace.
			He loves beyond our uttermost:
			In every room in our Father's house,
			He will be there, as Lord and host.
		</verse>
