	<verses>
		<verse>
			At first I prayed for light:
			Could I but see the way,
			How gladly, swiftly would I walk
			To everlasting day!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And next I prayed for strength:
			That I might tread the road
			With firm, unfaltering feet, and win
			The heaven's serene abode.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And then I asked for faith:
			Could I but trust my God,
			I'd live infolded in His peace,
			Though foes were all abroad.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But now I pray for love:
			Deep love to God and man;
			A living love that will not fail,
			However dark His plan.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And light and strength and faith
			Are opening everywhere!
			God waited patiently until
			I prayed the larger prayer.
		</verse>
