	<verses>
		<refrain>
			How shall we stand in that great day?
			How shall we stand in that great day?
			Shall we be found before Him wanting?
			Or with our sins all washed away?
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			The judgment has set, the books have been opened;
			How shall we stand in the great day
			When every thought, and word, and action,
			God the righteous Judge, shall weight?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The work is begun with those who are sleeping,
			Soon will the living here be tried,
			Out of the books of God's remembrance,
			His decision to abide.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O, how shall we stand that moment of searching,
			When all our sins those books reveal?
			When from that court, each case decided,
			Shall be granted no appeal?
		</verse>
