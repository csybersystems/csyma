	<verses>
		<verse>
			When morning gilds the skies
			my heart awaking cries,
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
			Alike at work and prayer,
			to Jesus I repair:
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Whene'er the sweet church bell
			peals over hill and dell,
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
			O hark to what it sings,
			as joyously it rings,
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The night becomes as day
			when from the heart we say:
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
			The powers of darkness fear
			when this sweet chant they hear:
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Ye nations of mankind,
			in this your concord find,
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
			Let all the earth around
			ring joyous with the sound,
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In heaven's eternal bliss
			the loveliest strain is this,
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
			Let earth, and sea and sky
			from depth to height reply,
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be this, while life is mine,
			My canticle divine,
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
			Be this th' eternal song
			Through all the ages long,
			May Jesus Christ be praised!
		</verse>
