			Blessed are those whose way is blameless,
			who walk in the law of the Lord!
			Blessed are those who keep his testimonies,
			who seek him with their whole heart.

			Put false ways far from me;
			and graciously teach me thy law!
			I have chosen the way of faithfulness,
			I set thy ordinances before me.

			Lead me in the path of thy commandments,

			Thy word is a lamp to my feet
			and a light to my path.

			therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
			He leads the humble in what is right,
			and teaches the humble his way.

			Your ears shall hear a word behind you,
			saying, "This is the way, walk in it,"
			when you turn to the right or when
			you turn to the left.
		</verse>

			I will instruct you and teach you the
			way you should go;
			I will counsel you with my eye upon you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"When the Spirit of truth comes,
			he will guide you into all the truth;
			for he will not speak on his own authority,
			but whatever he hears he will speak,
			and he will declare to you
			the things that are to come."
