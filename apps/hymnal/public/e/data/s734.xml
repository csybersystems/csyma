	<eTitle>CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS AND DEATH-II -- Matthew 27, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Early in the morning,
			all the chief priests and the elders of the people
			came to the decision to put Jesus to death.
			They bound him, led him away and handed 
			him over to Pilate, the governor.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"What shall I do, then,
			with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked. 
			They all answered, "Crucify him!" "Why? 
			What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate.
			But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then he released Barabbas to them.
			But he had Jesus flogged,
			and handed him over to be crucified.
			Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus
			into the Praetorium and gathered the whole
			company of soldiers around him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
			and then wove a crown of thorns and 
			set it on his head.
			They put a staff in his right hand and 
			knelt in front of him and mocked him.
			"Hail, King of the Jews!" they said.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			They spit on him,
			and took the staff and struck him on the head 
			again and again. After they had mocked him, 
			they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him.
			Then they led him away to crucify him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And when Jesus had cried out again
			in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			At that moment the curtain of the temple 
			was torn in two from top to bottom.
			The earth shook and the rocks split.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When the centurion and those with him who 
			were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake 
			and all that had happened,
			they were terrified, and exclaimed,
			"Surely he was the Son of God!"
		</verse>
