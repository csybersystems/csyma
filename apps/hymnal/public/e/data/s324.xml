	<verses>
		<verse>
			Just as I am, Thine own to be,
			Friend of the young, who lovest me,
			To consecrate myself to Thee,
			O Jesus Christ, I come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the glad morning of my day,
			My life to give, my vows to pay,
			With no reserve and no delay,
			With all my heart I come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I would live ever in the light;
			I would work ever for the right;
			I would serve Thee with all my might;
			Therefore, to Thee I come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Just as I am, young, strong, and free,
			To be the best that I can be
			For truth, and righteousness, and Thee,
			Lord of my life, I come.
		</verse>
