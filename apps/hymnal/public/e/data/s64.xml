	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing;
			fill our hearts with joy and peace;
			let us each, thy love possessing,
			triumph in redeeming grace.
			O refresh us, O refresh us,
			traveling through this wilderness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thanks we give and adoration
			for thy gospel's joyful sound.
			May the fruits of thy salvation
			in our hearts and lives abound;
			ever faithful, ever faithful
			to the truth may we be found.
		</verse>
