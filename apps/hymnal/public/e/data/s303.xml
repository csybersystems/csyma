		<verse>
			Beneath the cross of Jesus
			I fain would take my stand,
			the shadow of a mighty rock
			within a weary land;
			a home within the wilderness,
			a rest upon the way,
			from the burning of the noontide heat,
			and the burden of the day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Upon that cross of Jesus
			mine eye at times can see
			the very dying form of One
			who suffered there for me;
			and from my stricken heart with tears
			two wonders I confess:
			the wonders of redeeming love
			and my unworthiness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I take, O cross, thy shadow
			for my abiding place;
			I ask no other sunshine than
			the sunshine of his face;
			content to let the world go by,
			to know no gain nor loss,
			my sinful self my only shame,
			my glory all the cross.
		</verse>
