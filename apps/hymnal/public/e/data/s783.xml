	<eTitle>A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH -- Revelation 21, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
			for the first heaven and the first
			earth had passed away.
			Also there was no more sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem,
			coming down out of heaven from God,
			prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,
			"Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,
			and He will dwell with them,
			and they shall be His people,
			and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes;
			there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying;
			and there shall be no more pain, for the former
			things have passed away."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then He who sat on the throne said,
			"Behold, I make all things new." And He said to me,
			"Write, for these words are true and faithful."*
		</verse>
