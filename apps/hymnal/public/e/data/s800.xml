	<verses>
		<verse>
			"I am the true vine,
			and My Father is the vinedresser.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit,
			He takes away;
			and every branch that bears fruit,
			He prunes it, that it may bear more fruit.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"You are already clean because of
			the word which I have spoken to you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Abide in Me, and I in you.
			As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
			unless it abides in the vine,
			so neither can you,
			unless you abide in Me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I am the vine, you are the branches;
			he who abides in Me, and I in him,
			he bears much fruit;
			for apart from Me you can do nothing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"If anyone does not abide in Me,
			he is thrown away as a branch, and dries up;
			and they gather them,
			and cast them into the fire,
			and they are burned.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"If you abide in Me,
			and My words abide in you,
			ask whatever you wish,
			and it shall be done for you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"By this is My Father glorified,
			that you bear much fruit,
			and so prove to be My disciples.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Just as the Father has loved Me,
			I have also loved you; abide in My love.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"If you keep My commandments,
			you will abide in My love;
			just as I have kept My Father's commandments,
			and abide in His love."
