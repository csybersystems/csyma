	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Rouse, then soldiers! rally round the banner!
			Ready, steady, pass the word along;
			Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!
			Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Sound the battle cry, See! the foe is nigh;
			Raise the standard high For the Lord;
			Gird your armor on, Stand firm, every one, 
			Rest your cause upon His holy word.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Strong to meet the foe, Marching on we go,
			While our cause we know Must prevail;
			Shield and banner bright, Gleaming in the light,
			Battling for the right, We ne'er can fail.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Thou God of all, Hear us when we call,
			Help us, one and all, By Thy grace;
			When the battle's done, And the victory won,
			May we wear the crown Before Thy face.
		</verse>
