	<verses>
		<verse>
			"Keep my Sabbaths holy,
			that they may be a sign between us.
			Then you will know that I am the Lord your God."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"'[The Sabbath] will be a sign between me
			and the Israelites forever,
			for in six days the Lord made the
			heavens and the earth, and on the seventh
			Play he abstained from work and rested.'"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"As the new heavens and the new earth
			that I make will endure before me,"
			declares the Lord,
			"so will your name and descendants endure.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"From one New Moon to another and
			from one Sabbath to another,
			all mankind will come and bow
			down before me," says the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath
			and from doing as you please on my holy day,
			if you call the Sabbath a delight and
			the Lord's holy day honorable,
			and if you honor it by not going your own way
			and not doing as you please or speaking idle words,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"then you will Lind your joy in the Lord,
			and I will cause you to ride on the
			heights of the land and to feast on the
			inheritance of your father Jacob."
			The mouth of the Lord has spoken.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			[Jesus] went to Nazareth,
			where he had been brought up,
			and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue,
			as was his custom.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He said to them, *
			"If any of you has a sheep
			and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath,
			will you not take hold of it and lift it out?
			How much more valuable is a man	than a sheep!
			Therefore it is lawful to do good in the Sabbath!"
