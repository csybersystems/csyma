	<verses>
		<verse>
			O let me walk with Thee, my God,
			As Enoch walked in days of old;
			Place Thou my trembling hand in Thine,
			And sweet communion with me hold;
			E'en though the path I may not see,
			Yet, Jesus, let me walk with Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I cannot, dare not, walk alone;
			The tempest rages in the sky,
			A thousand snares beset my feet,
			A thousand foes are lurking nigh.
			Still Thou the raging of the sea,
			O Master! Let me walk with Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If I may rest my hand in Thine,
			I'll count the joys of earth but loss,
			And firmly, bravely journey on;
			I'll bear the banner of the cross
			Till Zion's glorious gates I see;
			Yet, Savior, let me walk with Thee.
		</verse>
