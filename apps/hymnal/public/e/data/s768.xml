	<verses>
		<verse>
			You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,
			a holy nation, His own special people,
			that you may proclaim the praises
			of Him who called you out of darkness
			into His marvelous light.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the grace of God that brings salvation
			has appeared to all men, teaching us that,
			denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
			we should live soberly, righteously,
			and godly in the present age,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			looking for the blessed hope and glorious
			appearing of our great God and
			Savior Jesus Christ,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			who gave Himself for us,
			that He might redeem us from every lawless deed
			and purify for Himself His own special people,
			zealous for good works.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations,
			baptizing them in the name of the 
			Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
			teaching them to observe all things
			that I have commanded you;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"and lo, I am with you always,
			even to the end of the age." Amen.
