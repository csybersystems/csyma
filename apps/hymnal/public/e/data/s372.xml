	<verses>
		<verse>
			How beauteous are their feet
			Who stand on Zion's hill;
			Who bring salvation on their tongues,
			And words of peace reveal!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How charming is their voice,
			So sweet the tidings are:
			"Zion, behold thy Savior King;
			He reigns and triumphs here!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How happy are our ears,
			That hear the joyful sound
			Which kings and prophets waited for,
			And sought, but never found!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How blessed are our eyes,
			That see this heavenly light;
			Prophets and kings desired it long,
			But died without the sight!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The watchmen join their voice,
			And tuneful notes employ;
			Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
			And deserts learn the joy.
		</verse>
