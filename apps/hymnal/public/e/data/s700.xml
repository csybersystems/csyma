	<eTitle>OH, SING TO THE LORD A NEW SONG -- Psalm 96, KJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Oh, sing to the Lord a new song! 
			Sing to the Lord, all the earth. 
			Sing to the Lord, bless His name;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Proclaim the good news of His
			salvation from day to day.
			Declare His glory among the nations, 
			His wonders among all peoples.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised; 
			He is to be feared above all gods. 
			For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
			But the Lord made the heavens.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Honor and majesty are before Him; 
			Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Give to the Lord, O kindreds of the peoples, 
			Give to the Lord glory and strength.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Give to the Lord the glory due His name;
			Bring an offering, and come into His courts.
			Oh, worship the Lord in the beauty	of holiness!
			Tremble before Him, all the earth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Say among the nations, "The Lord reigns;
			The world also is firmly established, 
			It shall not be moved;
			He shall judge the peoples righteously."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad;
			Let the sea roar, and all its fullness; 
			Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it.
			Then all the trees of the woods will rejoice before the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For He is coming, for He is coming to judge the earth.
			He shall judge the world with righteousness,
			And the peoples with His truth.
		</verse>
