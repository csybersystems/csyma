	<verses>
		<verse>
			Not I, but Christ, be honored, loved, exalted;
			Not I, but Christ, to seen, be known, be heard;
			Not I, but Christ, in every look and action,
			Not I, but Christ, in every thought and word.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Not I, but Christ, to gently soothe in sorrow,
			Not I, but Christ, to wipe the falling tear;
			Not I, but Christ, to lift the weary burden,
			Not I, but Christ, to hush away all fear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Christ, only Christ! No idle words e'er falling,
			Christ, only Christ; no needless bustling sound;
			Christ, only Christ, no self important bearing;
			Christ, only Christ, no trace of "I" be found.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Not I, but Christ, my every need supplying,
			Not I, but Christ, my strength and health to be;
			Christ, only Christ, for body, soul, and spirit,
			Christ, only Christ, here and eternally.
		</verse>
