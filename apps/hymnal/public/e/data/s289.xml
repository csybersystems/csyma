	<verses>
		<verse>
			The Savior is waiting to enter your heart,
			Why don't you let Him come in?
			There's nothing in this world to keep you apart,
			What is your answer to Him?
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Time after time He has waited before,
			And now He is waiting again
			To see if you're willing to open the door:
			O how He wants to come in.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			If you'll take one step toward the Savior, my friend,
			You'll find His arms open wide;
			Receive Him, and all of your darkness will end,
			Within your heart He'll abide.
		</verse>
