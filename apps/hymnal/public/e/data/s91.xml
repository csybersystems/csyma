		<verse>
			Ye watchers and ye holy ones,
			Bright seraphs, cherubim and thrones,
			Raise the glad strain, Alleluia!
			Cry out, dominions, princedoms, powers,
			Virtues, archangels, angels'choirs,
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Alleluia, Alleluia,
					Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			O higher than the cherubim,
			More glorious than the seraphim,
			Lead their praises, Alleluia!
			Thou bearer of the eternal Word,
			Most gracious, magnify the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O friends, in gladness let us sing,
			Supernal anthems echoing,
			Alleluia, Alleluia!
			To God the Father, God the Son,
			And God the Spirit, Three in One.
		</verse>
