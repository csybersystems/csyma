	<verses>
		<verse>
			Love consecrates the humblest act
			And haloes mercy's deeds;
			It sheds a benediction sweet
			And hallows human needs.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When in the shadow of the cross
			Christ knelt and washed the feet
			Of His disciples, He gave us
			A sign of love complete.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Love serves and willing, stoops to serve;
			What Christ in love so true
			Has freely done for one and all,
			Let us now gladly do!
		</verse>
