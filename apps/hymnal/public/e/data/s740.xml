	<eTitle>CHRIST THE DELIVERER -- Isaiah 43, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			This is what the Lord says-
			he who created you, 0 Jacob,
			he who formed you, 0 Israel:
			"Fear not, for I have redeemed you;
			I have called you by name; you are mine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"When you pass through the waters,
			I will be with you; 
			and when you pass through the rivers,
			they will not sweep over you.
			When you walk through the fire,
			you will not be burned;
			the flames will not set you ablaze.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"For I am the Lord, your God,
			the Holy One of Israel, your Savior....
			Since you are precious and honored in my sight,
			and because 1 love you,
			I will give men in exchange for you,
			and people in exchange for your life.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Do not be afraid, for I am with you;
			I will bring your children from
			the east and gather you from the west.
			I will say to the north, 'Give them up!'
			and to the south, 'Do not hold them back.'
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Bring my sons from afar
			and my daughters from the ends of the earth-
			everyone who is called by my name,
			whom I created for my glory,
			whom I formed and made."
		</verse>
