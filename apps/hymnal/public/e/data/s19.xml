	<verses>
		<verse>
			O sing a new song to the Lord
			For marvels He has done;
			His right hand and His holy arm
			The victory have won.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With harp,with harp and voice of psalms
			Unto Jehovah sing;
			Let trumpets and the echoing horn
			Acclaim the Lord our King!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let seas with all their creatures roar,
			The world and dwellers there,
			And let the rivers clap their hands,
			The hills their joy declare.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Before the Lord: because He comes,
			To judge the earth comes He;
			He'll judge the world with righteousness,
			His folk with equity.
		</verse>
