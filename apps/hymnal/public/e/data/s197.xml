	<verses>
		<verse>
			The King of love my Shepherd is,
			Whose goodness faileth never;
			I nothing lack if I am His,
			And He is mine forever.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Where streams of living water flow
			My ransomed soul He leadeth,
			And, where the verdant pastures grow,
			With food celestial feedeth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,
			But yet in love He sought me,
			And on His shoulder gently laid,
			And home, rejoicing, brought me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And so through all the length of days
			Thy goodness faileth never;
			Good Shepherd! I would sing Thy praise
			Within Thy house forever.
		</verse>
