		<refrain>
			Lo! he comes, lo!Jesus comes; Lo!
			He comes, He comes all glorious!
			Jesus comes to reign victorious, Lo!
			He comes, yes, Jesus comes!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking;
			Lo! the powers of heaven are shaking;
			Keep your lamps all trimmed and burning,
			Ready for your Lord's returning.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lo! the promise of your Savior,
			Pardoned sin and purchased favor,
			Blood-washed robes and crowns of glory;
			Haste to tell redemption's story.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Kingdoms at their base are crumbling,
			Hark! His chariot wheels are rumbling;
			Tell, O tell of grace abounding,
			While the seventh trump is sounding.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Nations wane, though proud and stately;
			Christ His kingdom hasteneth greatly;
			Earth her latest pasts is summing;
			Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;
			Now for you He's interceding;
			Haste, ere grace and time diminished
			Shall proclaim the mystery finished.
		</verse>
