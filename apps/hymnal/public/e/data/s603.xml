	<verses>
		<verse>
			Christian, seek not yet repose,
			Cast thy dreams of ease away;
			Thou art in the midst of foes;
			Watch and pray!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Gird thy heavenly armor on,
			Wear it ever, night and day;
			Ambushed lies the evil one;
			Watch and pray!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Hear the victors who o'er came;
			Still they mark each warrior's way;
			All with one sweet voice exclaim:
			"Watch and pray!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
			Him thou lovest to obey;
			Hide within thy heart His word:
			"Watch and pray!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Watch, as if on that alone
			Hung the issue of the day;
			Pray that help may be sent down;
			Watch and pray!
		</verse>
