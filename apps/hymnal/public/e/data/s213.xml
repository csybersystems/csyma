	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lift up the trumpet, and loud let it ring:
			Jesus is coming again! Cheer up, ye pilgrims,
			be joyful and sing; Jesus is coming again!
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Coming again, coming again,
			Jesus is coming again!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Echo it, hilltops; proclaim it, ye plains:
			Jesus is coming again! Coming in glory,
			the Lamb that was slain; Jesus is coming again!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Heavings of earth, tell the vast, wondering throng;
			Jesus is coming again! Tempests and whirlwinds,
			the anthem prolong; Jesus is coming again!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Nations are angry-by this we do know
			Jesus is coming again! Knowledge increases;
			men run to and fro; Jesus is coming again!
		</verse>
