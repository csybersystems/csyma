		<verse>
			Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
			Naught of this world's delusive dream:
			I have renounced all sinful pleasure-
			Jesus is mine! There's nothing between.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Nothing between my soul and Savior,
			So that His blessed face may be seen;
			Nothing preventing the least of His favor:
			Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Nothing between, like worldly pleasure:
			Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
			Must not my heart from Him ever sever-
			He is my all! There's nothing between.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Nothing between, e'n many hard trials,
			Though the whole world against me convene;
			Watching with prayer and much self denial-
			Triumph at last, With nothing between!
		</verse>
