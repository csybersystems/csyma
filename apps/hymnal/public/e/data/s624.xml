		<verse>
			I want Jesus to walk with me.
			I want Jesus to walk with me.
			All along my pilgrim journey,
			I want Jesus to walk with me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In my trials Lord, walk with me.
			In my trials Lord, walk with me.
			When the shades of life are falling,
			I want Jesus to walk with me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In my sorrows, Lord, walk with me.
			In my sorrows, Lord, walk with me.
			When my heart within is aching,
			I want Jesus to walk with me.
		</verse>
