	<verses>
		<refrain>
			I need no other evidence,
			I need no other plea,
			It is enough that Jesus died,
			And rose again for me.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			My faith has found a resting place,
			Not in man-made creed;
			I trust the Ever-living One,
			That He for me will plead.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Enough for me that Jesus saves,
			This ends my fear and doubt;
			A sinful soul I come to Him,
			He will not cast me out.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My soul is resting on the Word,
			The living Word of God,
			Salvation in my Savior's name,
			Salvation thro' His blood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The great Physician heals the sick,
			The lost he came to save;
			For me His precious blood He shed,
			For me His life He gave.
		</verse>
