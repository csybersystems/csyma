	<verses>
		<verse>
			Come, thou long expected Jesus,
			born to set thy people free;
			from our fears and sins release us,
			let us find our rest in thee.
			Israel's strength and consolation,
			hope of all the earth thou art;
			dear desire of every nation,
			joy of every longing heart.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Born thy people to deliver,
			born a child and yet a King,
			born to reign in us forever,
			now thy gracious kingdom bring.
			By thine own eternal spirit
			rule in all our hearts alone;
			by thine all sufficient merit,
			raise us to thy glorious throne.
		</verse>
