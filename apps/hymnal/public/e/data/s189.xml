	<eTitle>All That Thrills My Soul</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
			By His presence all divine?
			True and tender, pure and precious,
			Oh, how blest to call Him mine!
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
			He is more than life to me; (to me;)
			And the fairest of ten thousand,
			In my blessed Lord I see.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Love of Christ so freely given,
			Grace of God beyond degree,
			Mercy higher than the heaven,
			Deeper than the deepest sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Every need His hand supplying,
			Every good in Him I see;
			On His strength divine relying,
			He is All in All to me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			By the crystal flowing river
			With the ransomed I will sing,
			And forever and forever
			Praise and glorify the King
		</verse>
