	<verses>
		<verse>
			Guide me, O thou great Jehovah,
			pilgrim through this barren land.
			I am weak, but thou art mighty;
			hold me with thy powerful hand.
			Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,
			feed me till I want no more;
			feed me till I want no more.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Open now the crystal fountain,
			whence the healing stream doth flow;
			let the fire and cloudy pillar
			lead me all my journey through.
			Strong deliverer, strong deliverer,
			be thou still my strength and shield;
			be thou still my strength and shield.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When I tread the verge of Jordan,
			bid my anxious fears subside;
			death of death and hell's destruction,
			land me safe on Canaan's side.
			Songs of praises, songs of praises, 
			I will ever give to thee;
			I will ever give to thee.
		</verse>
