	<eTitle>ON THE INCARNATION* -- PhiliPpians 2, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Christ Jesus,... being in the form of God,
			did not consider it robbery
			to be equal with God,
			but made Himself of no reputation,
			taking the form of a servant,
			and coming in the likeness of men.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And being found in appearance as a man,
			He humbled Himself and became obedient
			to the point of death,	
			even the death of the cross.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore God also has highly exalted Him
			and given Him the name which is above every name,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			that at the name of Jesus
			every knee should bow,
			of those in heaven,
			and of those on earth,
			and of those under the earth,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			and that every tongue should confess
			that Jesus Christ is Lord,
			to the glory of God the Father.
		</verse>
