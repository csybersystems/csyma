		<refrain>
			I need thee, O I need thee;every hour I need thee;
			O bless me now, my Savior, I come to thee.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord;
			no tender voice like thine can peace afford.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I need thee every hour; stay thou nearby;
			temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I need thee every hour, in joy or pain;
			come quickly and abide, or life is vain.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I need thee every hour; teach me thy will;
			and thy rich promises in me fulfill.
