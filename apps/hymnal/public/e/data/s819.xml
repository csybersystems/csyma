	<eTitle>I CRY ALOUD TO THE LORD -- Psalm 142, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			I cry aloud to the Lord;
			I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.
			I pour out my complaint before him;
			before him I tell my trouble.
			When my spirit grows faint within me,
			it is you who know my way.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the path where I walk
			men have hidden a snare for me.
			Look to my right and see;
			no one is concerned for me.
			I have no refuge;
			no one cares for my life.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I cry to you, 0 Lord;
			I say, "You are my refuge,
			my portion in the land of the living."
			Listen to my cry,
			for I am in desperate need;
			rescue me from those who pursue me,
			for they are too strong for me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Set me free from my prison,
			that I may praise your name.
			Then the righteous will gather about me
			because of your goodness to me.
		</verse>
