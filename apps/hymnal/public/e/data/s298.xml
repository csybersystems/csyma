	<verses>
		<verse>
			I lay my sins on Jesus,
			The spotless Lamb of God;
			He bears them all, and frees us
			From the accursed load,
			From the accursed load.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I bring my guilt to Jesus,
			To wash my crimson stains
			White in His blood most precious,
			Till not a stain remains,
			Till not a stain remains.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I lay my wants on Jesus,
			All fullness dwells in Him;
			He healeth my diseases,
			He doth my soul redeem,
			He doth my soul redeem.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I long to be like Jesus,
			Meek loving, lowly, mild;
			I long to be like Jesus,
			The Father's holy child,
			The Father's holy child.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I long to be with Jesus
			Amid the heav'nly throng,
			To sing with them His praises,
			And learn the angels'song,
			And learn the angels'song.
		</verse>
