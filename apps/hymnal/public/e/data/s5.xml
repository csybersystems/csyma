	<verses>
		<verse>
			All my hope on God is founded;
				He doth still my trust renew,
				Me through change and chance He guideth,
				Only good and only true.
				God unknown, He alone Calls my heart to be His own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Pride of man and earthly glory,
				Sword and crown betray his trust;
				What with care and toil he buildeth,
				Tower and temple fall to dust.
				But God's power, hour by hour,
				Is my temple and my tower.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God's great goodness aye endureth,
				Deep His wisdom, passing thought:
				Splendor, light, and life attend Him,
				Beauty springeth out of naught.
				Love doth stand at His hand;
				Joy doth wait on His command.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Still from man to God eternal
				Sacrifice of praise be done,
				High above all praises praising
				For the gift of Christ His son.
				Christ doth call one and all:
				Ye who follow shall not fall.
		</verse>
