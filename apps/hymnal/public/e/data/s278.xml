	<eTitle>Lord Jesus, Once You Spoke to Men</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord Jesus, once You spoke to men
			Upon the mountain and the plain,
			O help us listen now as then
			And wonder at Your words again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We all have secret fears to face,
			Our minds and motives to amend.
			We seek Your truth, we need Your grace,
			Our living Lord and present friend.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The gospel speaks; and we receive
			Your light, Your love, Your own command.
			O help us live what we believe,
			In daily word of heart and hand.
		</verse>
