	<verses>
		<refrain>
			At the cross, at the cross,
			where I first saw the light,
			and the burden of my heart rolled away;
			it was there by faith I received my sight,
			and now I am happy all the day.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Alas! and did my Savior bleed,
			and did my Sovereign die?
			Would he devote that sacred head
			for sinners such as I?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Was it for crimes that I have done,
			he groaned upon the tree?
			Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
			And love beyond degree!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But drops of tears can ne'er repay
			the debt of love I owe.
			Here, Lord, I give myself away;
			'tis all that I can do.
		</verse>
