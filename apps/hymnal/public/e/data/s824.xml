	<verses>
		<verse>
			My dear friend,
			I hope everything is going happily with you
			and that you are as well physically
			as you are spiritually.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Your body, you know,
			is the temple of the Holy Spirit,
			who is in you since you received him from God.
			You are not your own property;
			you have been bought and paid for.
			That is why you should use your
			body for the glory of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Whatever you cat, whatever you drink,
			whatever you do at all,
			do it for the glory of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There is no need to worry;
			but if there is anything you need, pray for it,
			asking God for it with prayer and thanksgiving,
			and that peace of God,
			which is so much greater than we can understand,
			will guard your hearts and your thoughts,
			in Christ Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Finally, brothers,
			fill your minds with everything that is true,
			everything that is noble,
			everything that is good and pure,
			everything that we love and honour,
			and everything that can be thought
			virtuous or worthy of praise.
		</verse>
