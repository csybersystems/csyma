	<verses>
		<verse>
			Infant holy, infant lowly,
			For His bed a cattle stall;
			Oxen lowing, little knowing
			Christ the babe is Lord of all;
			Swift are winging angels singing,
			Noels ringing, tidings bringing,
			Christ the babe is Lord of all,
			Christ the babe is Lord of all.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping
			Vigil till the morning new;
			Saw the glory, heard the story,
			Tidings of the gospel true;
			Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow,
			Praising voicing greet the morrow,
			Christ the babe was born for you,
			Christ the babe was born for you.
