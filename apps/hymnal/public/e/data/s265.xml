		<verse>
			Breathe on me, Breath of God,
			Fill me with life anew,
			That I may love what Thou dost love,
			And do what Thou wouldst do.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Breathe on me, Breath of God,
			Until my heart is pure,
			Until with Thee I will one will,
			To do and to endure.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Breathe on me, Breath of God,
			Till I am wholly Thine,
			Until this earthly part of me
			Glows with Thy fire divine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Breathe on me, Breath of God,
			So shall I constant be,
			And live with Thee the perfect life
			Of Thine eternity
		</verse>
