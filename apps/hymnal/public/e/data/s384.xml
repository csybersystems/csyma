	<verses>
		<verse>
			Safely through another week
			God has brought us on our way;
			Let us now a blessing seek,
			Waiting in His courts today;
			Day of all the week the best,
			Emblem of eternal rest;
			Day of all the week the best,
			Emblem of eternal rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			While we seek supplies of grace
			Through the dear Redeemer's name,
			Show Thy reconciling face,
			Take away our sin and shame;
			From our worldly cares set free
			May we rest this day in Thee.
			From our worldly cares set free
			May we rest this day in Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When the morn shall bid us rise,
			May we feel Thy presence near,
			May Thy glory meet our eyes
			When we in Thy house appear;
			Here afford us, Lord, a taste
			Of our everlasting feast.
			Here afford us, Lord, a taste
			Of our everlasting feast.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May the gospel's joyful sound
			Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
			Make the fruits of grace abound,
			Bring relief to all complaints;
			Thus may all our Sabbaths be
			Till we rise to reign with Thee.
			Thus may all our Sabbaths be
			Till we rise to reign with Thee.
