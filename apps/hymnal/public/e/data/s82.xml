	<verses>
		<verse>
			Before Jehovah's awful throne,
			Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;
			Know that the Lord is God alone;
			He can create, and He destroy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His sovereign power, without our aid,
			Made us of clay, and formed us men;
			and when like wandering sheep we strayed,
			He brought us to His fold again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We'll crowd His gates with thankful songs,
			High as the heavens our voices raise;
			And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
			Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Wide as the world is His command,
			Vast as Eternity His love;
			Firm as a rock His truth shall stand,
			When rolling years shall cease to move.
		</verse>
