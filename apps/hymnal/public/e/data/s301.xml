		<verse>
			Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,
			Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;
			Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,
			Shelter me safe in that haven of rest,
			Shelter me safe in that haven of rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
			Nought as an offering to Jesus my King-
			Only my sinful now contrite heart;
			Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,
			Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine;
			Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,
			All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;
			Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,
			Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last;
			Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
			Through endless ages, ever to be,
			Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,
			Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee.
		</verse>
