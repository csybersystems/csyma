	<eTitle>CHRISTIAN DUTIES -- 1 Thessalonians 5, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Now we ask you, brothers,
			to respect those who work hard among you,
			who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you.
			Hold them in the highest regard in
			love because of their work.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Live in peace with each other.
			And we urge you, brothers,
			warn those who are idle,
			encourage the timid, help the weak,
			be patient with everyone.
			Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong,
			but always try to be kind to each
			other and to everyone else.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be joyful always; pray continually;
			give thanks in all circumstances,
			for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Do not put out the Spirit's fire;
			do not treat prophecies with contempt.
			Test everything. Hold on to the good.
			A void every kind of evil.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May God himself, the God of peace,
			sanctify you through and through.
			May your whole spirit,
			soul and body be kept blameless at
			the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
		</verse>
