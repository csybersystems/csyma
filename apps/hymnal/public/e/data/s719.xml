	<eTitle>OUR LORD THE CREATOR -- Isaiah 42 and 45, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			This is what God the Lord say--
			she who created the heavens and
			stretched them out,
			who spread out the earth,
			and all that comes out of it,
			who gives breath to its people,
			and life to those who walk on it.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I am the Lord, and there is no other;
			apart from me there is no God.
			I will strengthen you, though you
			have not acknowledged me,
			so that from the rising of the sun 
			to the place of its setting
			men may know there is none besides me.
			I am the Lord, and there is	no other."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"You heavens above, rain down righteousness;
			let the clouds shower it down.
			Let the earth open wide,
			let salvation spring up,
			let righteousness grow with it;
			I, the Lord, have created it."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For this is what the Lord says--
			he who created the heavens, he is God;
			he who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it;
			he did not create it to be empty,
			but formed it to be inhabited-- 
			he says:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I am the Lord,
			and there is no other. . . .
			Turn to me and be saved,
			all you ends of the earth; 
			for I am God, and there is no other."
		</verse>
