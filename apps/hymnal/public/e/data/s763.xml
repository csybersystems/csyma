	<eTitle>SANCTIFICATION -- 1 Corinthians 6, Hebrews 2, and Titus 3 NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Do you not know that the wicked will
			not inherit the kingdom of God?
			Do not be deceived:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters
			nor adulterers nor male prostitutes
			nor homosexual offenders nor thieves
			nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers
			nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And that is what some of you were.
			But you were washed, you were sanctified,
			You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
			and by the Spirit of our God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Both the one who makes men holy and those who are
			made holy are of the same family.
			So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Remind the people to be subject to rulers
			and authorities, to be obedient,
			to be ready to do whatever is good,
			to slander no one,
			to be peaceable and considerate,
			and to show true humility toward all men.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			At one time we too were foolish, disobedient,
			deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions
			and pleasures.	
			We lived in malice and envy,
			being hated and hating one another.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But when the kindness and love of God our Savior
			'appeared, he saved us, not because of
			righteous things we had done,
			but because of his mercy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He saved us through the washing of rebirth
			and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
			whom he poured out on us generously
			through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that,
			having been justified by his grace, 
			we might become heirs
			having the hope of eternal life.
		</verse>
