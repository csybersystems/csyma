	<eTitle>OUR CIVIC DUTIES -- Romans 13, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Everyone must submit himself
			to the governing authorities,
			for there is no authority except
			that which God has established.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The authorities that exist
			have been established by God.	
			Consequently, he who rebels against
			the authority is rebelling against
			what God has instituted,
			and those who do so will bring
			judgment on themselves.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For rulers hold no terror for those who do right,
			but for those who do wrong.
			Do you want to be free from fear
			of the one in authority?
			Then do what is right and he will commend you.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For he is God's servant to do you good.
			But if you do wrong, be afraid,
			for he does not bear the sword for nothing.
			He is God's servant,
			an agent of wrath to bring punishment
			on the wrongdoer.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore, it is necessary
			to submit to the authorities,
			not only because of possible punishment
			but also because of conscience.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This is also why you pay taxes,
			for the authorities are God's servants,
			who give their full time to governing.
			Give everyone what you owe him:
			If you owe taxes, pay taxes;
			if revenue, then revenue;
			if respect, then respect,
			if honor, then honor.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let no debt remain outstanding,
			except the continuing debt to love one another,
			for he who loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law.
		</verse>
