	<eTitle>THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD -- Micah 6 and 7, and Hosea 14, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			With what shall I come before the Lord
			and bow down before 'the exalted God?
			Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
			with calves a year old?
			Will the Lord be pleased with thou sands of rams,
			with ten thousand rivers of oil?
			Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression,
			the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He has showed you, 0 man, what is good.
			And what does the Lord require of you?
			To act justly and to love mercy and
			to walk humbly with your God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who is a God like you,
			who pardons sin and forgives the transgression
			of the remnant of his inheritance?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You do not stay angry forever
			but delight to show mercy.
			You will again have compassion on us;
			you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl
			all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Return, 0 Israel, to the Lord your God.
			Your sins have been your downfall!
			Take words with you and return to the Lord.
			Say to him:
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously,
			that we may offer the fruit of our lips."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I will heal their waywardness and love them freely,
			for my anger has turned away from them."
		</verse>
