	<verses>
		<verse>
			My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine;
			for thee all the follies of sin I resign.
			My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou;
			if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I love thee because thou hast first loved me,
			and purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
			I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow; 
			if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee 'til death,
			And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
			And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,
			if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In mansions of glory and endless delight;
			I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright;
			I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;
			if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
		</verse>
