	<eTitle>LIVING BREAD -- John 6, NEB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life.
			Whoever comes to me shall never be hungry,
			and whoever believes in me shall never be thirsty.
			But you, as I said, do not believe
			although you have seen.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"All that the Father gives me will come to me,
			and the man who comes to me I will never turn away.
			I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will,
			but the will of him who sent me.
			It is his will that I should not lose
			even one of all that he has given me,
			but raise them all up on the last day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"For it is my Father's will that everyone
			who looks upon the Son and puts his
			faith in him shall possess eternal life;
			and I will raise him up on the last day."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"In truth, in very truth I tell you,
			the believer possesses eternal life.
			I am the bread of life.
			Your forefathers ate the manna in
			the desert and they are dead.
			I am speaking of the bread that
			comes  down from heaven,
			which a man may eat, and never die.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"I am that living bread which has
			come down from heaven;
			if anyone eats this bread he shall live for ever.
			Moreover, the bread which I will
			give is my own flesh;	
			I give it for the life of the world."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			This led to a fierce dispute among the Jews.
			"How can this man give us his
			flesh to eat?" they said.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus replied, "In truth, in very truth I tell you,
			unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
			drink his blood you can have no life in you.
			Whoever eats my flesh and drinks
			my blood possesses eternal life,
			and I will raise him up on the last day.
			My flesh is real food; my blood is real drink.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
			dwells continually in me and I dwell in him.
			As the living Father sent me,
			and I live because of the Father,
			so he who eats me shall live because of me.
			This is the bread which came down from heaven;
			and it is not like the bread which our fathers ate:
			they are dead,
			but whoever eats this bread shall live for ever."
