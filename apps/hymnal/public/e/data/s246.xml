		<verse>
			Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
			Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
			Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
			That was slain.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Glory, hallelujah! Praise Him, hallelujah!
			Glory, hallelujah! To the Lamb!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Savior, let Thy kingdom come!
			Now the power of sin consume;
			Bring Thy blest millennium, Holy Lamb.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thus may we each moment feel,
			Love Him, serve Him, praise Him still,
			Till we all on Zion's hill see the Lamb.
