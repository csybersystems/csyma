	<verses>
		<refrain>
			I'm a child of the king, a child of the King!
			With Jesus, my Savior, I'm a child of the King!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			My Father is rich in houses and lands;
			He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
			Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
			His coffers are full- he has riches untold.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My Father's own Son, the Savior of men,
			Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
			But now He is pleading for sinners on high,
			And will give me a home when He comes by and by.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I once was an outcast, a stranger on earth,
			A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth!
			But I've been adopted, my name's written down,
			An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			A tent or a cottage, O why should I care?
			They're building a palace for me over there!
			Though exiled from home, yet still I may sing:
			"All glory to god, I'm a child of the King."
		</verse>
