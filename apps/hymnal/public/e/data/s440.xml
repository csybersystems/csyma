	<verses>
		<verse>
			How cheering is the Christian's hope,
			While toiling here below!
			It bouys us up while this passing through
			This wilderness of woe,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It bouys us up while this passing through
			This wilderness of woe,
			It bouys us up while passing through
			This wilderness of woe.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It points us to a land of rest,
			Where saints with Christ will reign;
			Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
			And never part again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Fly, lingering moments, fly, O, fly,
			Dear Savior, quickly come!
			We long to see Thee as Thou art,
			And reach that blissful home.
		</verse>
