	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Under His wings, under His wings,
			Who from His love can sever?
			Under His wings, my soul shall abide,
			Safely abide forever.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Under His wings I am safely abiding;
			Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
			Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;
			he has redeemed me, and I am His child.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
			How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!
			Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
			There I find comfort, and there I am blest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!
			There will I hide till life's trials are over;
			Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
			Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.
		</verse>
