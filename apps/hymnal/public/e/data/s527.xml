	<verses>
		<verse>
			From ev'ry stormy wind that blows,
			From ev'ry swelling tide of woes,
			There is a calm, a sure retreat;
			'Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There is a place where Jesus sheds
			The oil of gladness on our heads,
			A place than all besides more sweet;
			It is the blood bought mercy-seat.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There is a scene where spirits blend,
			Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
			Though sundered far, by faith they meet
			Around one common mercy-seat.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There, there on angels' wings we soar,
			And earthly care molest no more;
			And heaven comes down our souls to greet,
			And glory crowns the mercy-seat.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Ah! whither could we flee for aid,
			When tempted, desolate, dismayed?
			Or how the hosts of sin defeat,
			Had suffering saints no mercy-seat?
		</verse>
