	<verses>
		<refrain>
			At His feet we humbly fall,
			Crown Him, crown Him Lord of all.
			At His feet we humbly fall- the Lord of all.
			Crown Him, crown Him, Jesus, Jesus,
			Crown Him Lord of all.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Who is He in yonder stall,
			At whose feet the shepherds fall?
			'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
			'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who is He in deep distress,
			Fasting in the wilderness?
			'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
			'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who is He, the gathering throng
			Greet with loud triumphant song?
			'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
			'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lo, at midnight, who is He
			Prays in dark Gethsemane?
			'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
			'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who is He on yonder tree
			Dies in shame and agony?
			'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
			'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who is He that from the grave
			Comes to heal and help and save?
			'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
			'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who is He that from His throne
			Rules through all the world alone?
			'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
			'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
