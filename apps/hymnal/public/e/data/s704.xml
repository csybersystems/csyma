	<eTitle>IF I LIFT UP MY EYES TO THE HILLS -- Psalm 121, NEB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			If I lift up my eyes to the hills,
			where shall I find help?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Help comes only from the Lord,
			maker of heaven and earth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How could he let your foot stumble?
			How could he, your guardian, sleep?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The guardian of Israel
			never slumbers, never sleeps.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord is your guardian,
			your defence at your right hand;
			the sun will not strike you by day
			nor the moon by night.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord will guard you against	all evil;
			he will guard you, body	and soul.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord will guard your going and 
			your coming, now and for evermore.
		</verse>
