	<eTitle>The Old Rugged Cross</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<refrain>
			So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
			till my trophies at last I lay down;
			I will cling to the old rugged cross,
			and exchange it some day for a crown.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
			the emblem of suffering and shame;
			and I love that old cross where the dearest and best
			for a world of lost sinners was slain.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
			has a wondrous attraction for me;
			for the dear Lamb of God left his glory above
			to bear it to dark Calvary.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To that old rugged cross I will ever be true,
			its shame and reproach gladly bear;
			then he'll call me some day to my home far away,
			where his glory forever I'll share.
		</verse>
