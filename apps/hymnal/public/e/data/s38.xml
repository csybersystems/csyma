		<verse>
			Arise, my soul, arise! Stretch
			forth to things eternal
			And hasten to the feet of your Redeemer God.
			Though hid from mortal eyes,
			He dwells in light supernal;
			Yet worship Him in humbleness and call Him Lord.
			His banquet of love Awaits you above;
			Yet here He grants a foretaste of the feast to
			the feast to come! Rejoice, my soul, rejoice,
			To heav'n lift up your voice:
			Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now hear the harps of heav'n!
			Oh, hear the song victorious,
			The neverending anthem sounding through the sky!
			To mortals is not giv'n To join in strains so glorious;
			Yet here on earth we too can sing our praises high!
			He bought with His blood The ransomed of God;
			To Him be ever lasting pow'r and victory.
			And let the great amen Resound through heav'n again.
			Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
