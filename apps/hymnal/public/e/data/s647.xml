		<refrain>
			Glory! Glory! Halelujah! Glory! Glory! Halelujah!
			Glory! Glory! Halelujah! His truth is marching on.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
			He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
			He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
			His truth is marching on.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
			He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
			O be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
			Our God is marching on.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
			With the glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
			As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free!
			While God is marching on.
		</verse>
