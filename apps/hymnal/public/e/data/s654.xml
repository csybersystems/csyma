	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord, bless our homes with peace and love and laughter,
			With understanding and with loyalty.
			May we together follow Christ the Master
			And know the blessing of His sovereignty.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May every heart receive His loving spirit
			And know the truth that makes life truly free;
			Then, in that spirit may we live united,
			And find in God our deep security.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Forgive the hurts our selfishness inflicted
			On those we love and those who love us best.
			Christ, heal the scars, and draw us all together
			In him whose will is peace and joy and rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Father, in gratitude for homes and loved ones,
			We open now our hearts to all mankind.
			Grant us Your spirit  love for one another-
			So in Your peace may we our concord find.
		</verse>
