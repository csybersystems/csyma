	<verses>
		<refrain>
			"Hold fast till I come;" sweet promises of heaven-
			"The kingdom restored, to you shall be given."
			"Come, enter My joy, sit down on My throne;
			Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come."
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Sweet promises is given to all who believe-
			"Behold I come quickly, Mine own to receive;
			Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;
			Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We'll "watch unto prayer" with lamps burning bright;
			He comes to all others a "thief in the night."
			We know He is near, but know not that day-
			As spring shows that summer is not far away.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yes! This is our hope, 'tis built on His word-
			The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;
			Of promises all, it stands as the sum:
			"Behold I come quickly, hold fast till I come."
		</verse>
