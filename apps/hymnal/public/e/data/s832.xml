	<eTitle>OUT OF THE DEPTHS -- Psalm 130, NKJV (De Profundis)</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Out of the depths I have cried to You, 0 Lord;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, hear my voice!
			Let Your ears be attentive
			To the voice of my supplications.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If You, Lord, should mark iniquities,
			O Lord, who could stand?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But there is forgiveness with You,
			That You may be feared.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I wait for the Lord, my soul waits,
			And in His word I do hope.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My soul waits for the Lord
			More than those who watch for the morningâ€”
			I say, more than those who watch for the morning.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Israel, hope in the Lord;
			For with the Lord there is mercy,
			And with Him is abundant redemption.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And He shall redeem Israel
			From all his iniquities.
		</verse>
