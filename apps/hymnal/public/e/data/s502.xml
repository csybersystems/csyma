		<verse>
			Sun of my soul, O Savior dear,
			It is not night if Thou be near;
			O may no earth-born cloud arise
			To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When the soft dews of kindly sleep
			My wearied eyelids gently steep
			Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
			Forever on my Savior's breast.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Abide with me from morn till eve,
			For without Thee I cannot live;
			Abide with me when night is nigh,
			For without Thee I dare not die.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be near and bless me when I wake,
			Ere through the world my way I take;
			Till in the ocean of Thy love
			I lose myself in heaven above.
		</verse>
