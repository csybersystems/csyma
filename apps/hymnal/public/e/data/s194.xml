	<verses>
		<verse>
			Sing we of the modern city,
			Scene alike of joy and stress;
			Sing we of its namelss people
			In their urban wilderness.
			Into endless rows of houses
			Life is set a millionfold,
			Life expressed in human beings
			Daily born and growing old.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In the city full of people,
			World of speed and hectic days,
			In the everchanging setting
			Of the latest trend and craze,
			Christ is present, and among us;
			In the crowd we see Him stand.
			In the bustle of the city
			Jesus Christ is every man.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God is not remote in heaven,
			But on earth to share our shame,
			Changing graph and mass and number
			Into persons with a name.
			Christ has shown, beyond statistics,
			Human life with glory crowned,
			By His timeless presence proving
			People matter, people count!
		</verse>
