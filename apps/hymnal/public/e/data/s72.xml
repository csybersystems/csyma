		<verse>
			Creator of the stars of night,
			Thy people's ever lasting light,
			O Christ, Thou Savior of us all,
			We pray Thee, hear us when we call.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			At the great name of Jesus, now
			All knees must bend, all hearts must bow;
			And things celestial Thee shall own,
			And things terrestial, Lord alone.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To God the Father, God the Son,
			And God the Spirit, Three in one,
			Laud, honor, might, and glory be
			From age to age eternally. Amen.
		</verse>
