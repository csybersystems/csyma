	<verses>
		<verse>
			I love thy kingdom, Lord,
			the house of thine abode,
			the church our blest Redeemer saved
			with his own precious blood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I love thy church, O God!
			Her walls before thee stand
			dear as the apple of thine eye,
			and graven on thy hand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Beyond my highest joy
			I prize her heavenly ways,
			her sweet communion, solemn vows,
			her hymns of love and praise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sure as thy truth shall last,
			to Zion shall be given
			the brightest glories earth can yield,
			and brighter bliss of heaven.
		</verse>
