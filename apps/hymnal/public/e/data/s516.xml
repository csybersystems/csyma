		<verse>
			All the way my savior leads me;
			What have I to ask beside?
			Can I doubt His tender mercy,
			Who thro' life has been my guide?
			heav'nly peace divinest comfort,
			Here by faith in Him to dwell!
			For I know whate'er befall me,
			Jesus doeth all things well;
			For I know whate'er befall me,
			Jesus doeth all things well;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All the way my Savior leads me;
			Cheers each winding path I tread,
			Gives me grace for ev'ry trial,
			Feeds me with the living bread;
			Tho' my weary steps may falter,
			And my soul athirst may be,
			Gushing from the Rock before me,
			Lo! a spring of joy I see;
			Gushing from the Rock before me,
			Lo! a spring of joy I see;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All the way, my Savior leads me;
			Oh, the fullness of His love!
			Perfect rest to me is promised
			In my Father's house above:
			When I wake to life immortal,
			Wings my flight to realms of day,
			This my song thro' endless ages:
			Jesus led me all the way;
			This my song thro' endless ages:
			Jesus led me all the way;
		</verse>
