		<verse>
			That glorious day is coming,
			The hour is hastening on;
			Its radiant light is nearing,
			Far brighter than the sun;
			In yonder clouds of heaven,
			The Savior will appear,
			And gather all His chosen,
			To meet Him in the air.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The saints, then all victorious
			Will go to meet their Lord;
			An earth both bright and glorious,
			Will then be their reward;
			And God Himself there reigning,
			Will wipe all tears away;
			Nor clouds nor night remaining,
			But one eternal day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Christian, keep from sleeping,
			And let your love abound;
			Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,
			The trumpet soon will sound!
			O sinner, hear the warning!
			To Jesus quickly!
			Then you, in that blest morning,
			May meet Him in the sky!
		</verse>
