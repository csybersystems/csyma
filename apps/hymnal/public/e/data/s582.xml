	<verses>
		<verse>
			Working, O Christ, with Thee, working with Thee,
			Unworthy, sinful, weak, though we may be;
			Our all to Thee we give, for alone we live,
			And by Thy grace achieve, working with Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Along the city's waste, working with Thee,
			Our eager  footsteps haste, like Thee to be;
			The poor we gather in, the outcasts raise from sin,
			And labor souls to win, working with Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Savior, we weary not, working with Thee,
			As hard as Thine our lot can never be;
			Our joy and comfort this, "Thy grace sufficient is;"
			This changes toil to bliss, working with Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So let us labor on, working with Thee,
			Till earth to Thee is won, from sin set free;
			Till men, from shore to shore, receive Thee, and adore,
			And join us evermore, working  with Thee.
		</verse>
