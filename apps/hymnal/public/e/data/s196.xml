		<refrain>
			Tell me the old, old story,
			Tell me the old, old story,
			Tell me the old, old story,
			Of Jesus and His love;
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Tell me the old, old story, Of unseen things above,
			Of Jesus and His glory, Of Jesus and His love;
			Tell me the story simply, As to a little child,
			For I am weak and weary, And helpless and defiled.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Tell me the story softly, With earnest tones and grave;
			Remember I'm the sinner Whom Jesus came to save;
			Tell me the story always, If you would really be,
			In any time of trouble, A comforter to me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Tell me the same old story, When you have cause to fear
			That this world's empty glory Is costing me too dear;
			Yes, and when that world's glory Is dawning on my soul
			Tell me the old, old story: "Christ Jesus makes thee whole."
		</verse>
