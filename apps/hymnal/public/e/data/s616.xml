	<verses>
		<verse>
			Soldiers of Christ, arise,
			And put your armor on,
			Strong in the strength which God supplies
			Through His eternal Son;
			Strong in the Lord of hosts,
			And in His mighty power,
			Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
			Is more than conqueror.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Stand, then, in His great might,
			With all His strength endued;
			But take, to arm you for the fight,
			The panoply of God;
			That, having all things done,
			And all your conflicts passed,
			You may o'ercome thro' Christ alone,
			And stand entire at last.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			From strength to strength go on;
			Wrestle, and fight, and pray;
			Tread all the powers of darkness down,
			And win the well-fought day;
			Still let the Spirit cry,
			In all His soldiers "Come!"
			Till Christ the Lord who reigns on high
			Shall take the conquerors home.
		</verse>
