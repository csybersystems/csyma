		<verse>
			Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
			Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
			Redeemed thro' His infinite mercy,
			His child, and forever, I am.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Redeemed, redeemed,
			Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
			Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
			His child and forever I am.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I think of my blessed Redeemer,
			I think of Him all the day long;
			I sing, for I cannot be silent;
			His love is the theme of my song.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I know I shall see in His beauty
			The King in whose law I delight,
			Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
			And giveth me songs in the night.
		</verse>
