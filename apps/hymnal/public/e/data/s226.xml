		<verse>
			Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!
			Behold the King of glory waits;
			The King of kings is drawing near,
			The Savior of the world is here.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord is just, a helper tried;
			Mercy is ever at His side;
			His kingly crowns is holiness,
			His scepter, pity in distress.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O blest the land, the city blest,
			Where Christ the Ruler is confessed!
			O happy hearts and happy homes
			To whom this King in triumph comes!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Fling wide the portals of your heart;
			Make it a temple, set apart
			From earthly use for heaven's employ,
			Adorned with prayer, and love, and joy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Redeemer, come; I open wide
			My heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide.
			Let me Thy inner presence feel,
			Thy grace and love in me reveal.
		</verse>
