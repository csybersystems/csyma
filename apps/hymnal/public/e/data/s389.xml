		<verse>
			Light of light, enlighten me,
			Now anew the day is dawning;
			Sun of grace, the shadows flee;
			Brighten Thou my Sabbath morning;
			With Thy joyous sunshine blest,
			Happy is my day of rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let me with my heart today,
			Holy, holy, holy, singing,
			Rapt awhile from earth away,
			All my soul to Thee up springing,
			Have a foretaste inward given
			How they worship Thee in heaven.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Hence all care, all vanity!
			For the day to God is holy;
			Come, Thou glorious Majesty,
			Deign to fill this temple lowly;
			Nought today my soul shall move,
			Simply resting in Thy love.
		</verse>
