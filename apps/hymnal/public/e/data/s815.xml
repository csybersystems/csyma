	<eTitle>WATCHFULNESS -- Deuteronomy 4, Colossians 2, 1 Peter 5,2 Thessalonians 2, and Mark 13, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Only be careful,
			and watch yourselves closely
			so that you do not forget the things
			your eyes have seen,
			or let them slip from your heart as
			long as you live.
			Teach them to your children and
			to their children after them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be careful not to forget the covenant of
			the Lord your God that he made with you;
			do not make for yourselves an idol in the form
			of anything the Lord your God has forbidden.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord,
			continue to live in him, rooted and built up in him,
			strengthened in the faith as you were taught,
			and overflowing with thankfulness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			See to it that no one takes you captive
			through hollow and deceptive philosophy,
			which depends on human tradition and
			the basic principles of this
			world rather than on Christ.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Be self-controlled and alert.
			Your enemy the devil prowls around
			like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Resist him, standing firm in the faith,
			because you know that your brothers
			throughout the world are undergoing
			the same kind of sufferings.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So then, brothers, stand firm and hold
			to the teachings we passed on to you,
			whether by word of mouth or by letter.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Be on guard! Be alert!
			You do not know when that time will come."
			"What I say to you, I say to every one: 'Watch!'"
		</verse>
