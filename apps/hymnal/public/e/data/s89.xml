	<verses>
		<verse>
			Let all the earth their voices raise,
			To sing the great Jehovah's praise,
			And bless His holy name:
			His glory let the people know,
			His wonders to the nations show,
			His saving grace proclaim.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He framed the globe; He built the sky;
			He made the shining worlds on high,
			And reigns in glory there:
			His beams are majesty and light;
			His beauties, how divinely bright!
			His dwelling place, how fair!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, the great day, the glorious hour,
			When earth shall feel His saving power,
			All nations fear His name;
			Then shall the race of men confess
			The beauty of His holiness,
			His saving grace proclaim.
		</verse>
