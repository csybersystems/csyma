	<eTitle>THE GREAT CONTROVERSY -- Revelation 12 and 11, RSV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Now war arose in heaven,
			Michael and his angels
			fighting against the dragon;
			and the dragon and his angels fought,
			but they were defeated and there was no
			longer any place for them in heaven.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And the great dragon was thrown down,
			that ancient serpent, who is called
			the Devil and Satan,
			the deceiver of the whole world
			he was thrown down to the earth,
			and his angels were thrown down with him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And I heard a loud voice in heaven,	saying,
			"Now the salvation and the power and
			the kingdom of our God and the authority of
			his Christ have come,
			for the accuser of our brethren has
			been thrown down,	
			who accuses them day and night
			before our God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"And they have conquered him by the blood
			of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,
			for they loved not their lives even unto death.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Rejoice then, 0 heaven and you that dwell therein!
			But woe to you, 0 earth and sea,
			for the devil has come down to you in great wrath,
			because he knows that his time is short!"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And there were loud voices in heaven, saying
			"The kingdom of the world bas become
			the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,
			and be shall reign for ever	and ever."
		</verse>
