	<eTitle>Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, I my cross have taken,
			All to leave and follow Thee;
			All things else I have forsaken;
			Thou from hence my all shalt be.
			Perish every fond ambition,
			All I've sought, or hoped, or known;
			Yet how rich is my condition,
			While I prove the Lord my own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let the world despise and leave me-
			They have left my Savior, too;
			Human hearts and looks deceive me-
			Thou art faithful, Thou art true.
			O, 'tis not in grief to harm me,
			While Thy love is left to me;
			O, 'twere not in joy to charm me,
			If that love be hid from me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Soul, then know thy full salvation;
			Rise o'er sin, and fear, and care;
			Joy to find in every station
			Something still to do or bear.
			Think what Spirit dwells within thee;
			Think what Father's smiles are thine;
			Think that Jesus died to win thee;
			Child of Heaven, canst thou repine?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Haste thee on from grace to glory,
			Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
			Heaven's eternal day's before thee;
			God's own hand shall guide thee there.
			Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
			Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;
			Hope shall change to glad fruition,
			Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
		</verse>
