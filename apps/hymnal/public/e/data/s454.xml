		<refrain>
			I am bound for the kingdom,
			Will you go to glory with me?
			Hallelujah! O praise ye the Lord!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Don't you see my Jesus coming,
			See Him come in yonder cloud?
			With ten thousand angels round Him,
			How they do my Jesus crowd!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Don't you see the saints ascending,
			Hear them shouting thro' the air.
			Jesus smiling, trumpets sounding,
			Now His glory they shall share.
