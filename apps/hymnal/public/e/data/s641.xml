	<verses>
		<verse>
			God in His love for us lent us this planet,
			Gave it a purpose in time and in space:
			Small as a spark from the fire of creation,
			Cradle of life and the home of our race.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thanks be to God for its bounty and beauty,
			Life that sustains us in body and mind:
			Plenty for all, if we learn how to share it,
			Riches undreamed of to fathom and find.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;
			Long has earth bowed to the terror of forced;
			Long have we wasted what others have need of,
			Poisoned the fountain of life at its source.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Earth is the Lord's: it is ours to enjoy it,
			Ours, as His stewards, to farm and defend.
			From its pollution, misuse, and destruction,
			Good Lord, deliver us, world without end!
		</verse>
