	<verses>
		<refrain>
			O it must be the breaking of the day!
			O it must be the breaking of the day!
			The night is almost gone, The day is coming on;
			O it must be the breaking of the day!
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			'Tis almost time for the Lord to come,
			I hear the people say;
			The stars of heaven are growing dim,
			It must be the breaking of the day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
			In earth and sea and sky,
			Aloud proclaim to all mankind,
			The coming of the Master draweth nigh.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			It must be time for the waiting church
			To cast her pride away,
			With girded loins and burning lamps,
			To look for the breaking of the day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Go quickly out in streets and lanes
			And in the broad highway,
			And call the maimed, the halt, and blind,
			To be ready for the breaking of the day.
		</verse>
