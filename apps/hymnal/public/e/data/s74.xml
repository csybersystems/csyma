	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Trusting in Jehovah, hearts are fully blessed
			Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Like a river glorious, is God's perfect peace,
			Over all victorious, in its bright increase;
			Perfect, yet it floweth, fuller every day,
			Perfect, yet it groweth, deeper all the way.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,
			Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;
			Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,
			Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Every joy or testing comes from above,
			Given to His children as act of Love;
			We may trust Him fully all for us to do.
			Those trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.
		</verse>
