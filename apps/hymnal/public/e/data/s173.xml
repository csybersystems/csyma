			Good Christian friends, rejoice and sing!
			Now is the triumph of our King!
			To all the world glad news we bring:
					Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The Lord of life is risen for aye;
			Bring flowers of song to strew His way;
			Let all mankind rejoice and say:
					Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise we in songs of victory
			That love, that life which cannot die,
			And sing with hearts uplifted high:
					Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thy name we bless, O risen Lord,
			And sing today with one accord
			The life laid down, the life restored:
					Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
		</verse>
