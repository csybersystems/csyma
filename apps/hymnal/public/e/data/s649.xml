	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord, while for all mankind we pray,
			Of every clime and coast,
			O hear us from our native land,
			The land we love the most.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O guard our shores form every foe;
			With peace our borders bless;
			With prosperous times our cities crown,
			Our fields with plenteousness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Unite us in the sacred love
			Of knowledge, truth, and Thee,
			And let our hills and valleys shout
			The songs of liberty.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord of the nations, thus to Thee
			Our country we commend;
			Be Thou her refuge and her trust,
			Her everlasting friend.
		</verse>
