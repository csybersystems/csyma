	<eTitle>GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT -- 1 Corinthians 12, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Now about spiritual gifts, brothers,
			I do not want you to be ignorant.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There are different kinds of gifts,
			but the same Spirit.
			There are different kinds of service,
			but the same Lord.
			There are different kinds of working,
			but the same God works all of them in all men.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now to each one the manifestation of
			the Spirit is given for the common good.
			To one there is given through the
			Spirit the message of wisdom,
			to another the message of knowledge
			by means of the same Spirit;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			to another faith by the same Spirit,
			to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,
			to another miraculous powers,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			to another prophecy,
			to another the ability to distinguish
			between spirits,
			to another the ability to speak
			in different kinds of tongues,
			and to still another
			the interpretation of tongues.
			
			All these are the work of one
			and the same Spirit,
			and he gives them to each man,
			just as he determines.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The body is a unit,
			though it is made up of many parts;
			and though all its parts are many,
			they form one body.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			So it is with Christ.
		</verse>
