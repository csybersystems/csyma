	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
			while on others thou art calling, 
			do not pass me by.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Pass me not, O gentle Savior, 
			hear my humble cry;
			while on others thou art calling, 
			do not pass me by.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let me at thy throne of mercy 
			find a sweet relief,
			kneeling there in deep contrition; 
			help my unbelief.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Trusting only in thy merit, 
			would I seek thy face;
			heal my wounded, broken spirit, 
			save me by thy grace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou the spring of all my comfort, 
			more than life for me,
			whom have I on earth beside thee? 
			Whom in heaven but thee?
