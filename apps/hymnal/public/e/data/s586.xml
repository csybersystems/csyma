	<verses>
		<verse>
			What joy it is to worship here,
			And find ourselves at home,
			Where God, who uses every gift,
			Has room for all who come!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yet are no two of us alike
			Of all the human race,
			And we must seek a common ground
			If we would share His grace.
		</verse>
