		<verse>
			I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;
			Teach; Teach me how, teach me how;
			I would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;
			Help me, help me now.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Wholly Thine, (O Lord) wholly Thine, (O Lord),
			Wholly Thine, this is my vow;
			Wholly Thine, (O Lord) wholly Thine, (O Lord),
			Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			What is worldly pleasure, wealth , or fame,
			Without Thee, without Thee?
			I will leave them all for Thy dear name,
			This my wealth shall be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			As I cast earth's transient joys behind,
			Come Thou near, come Thou near;
			In Thy presence all in all I find.
			'Tis my comfort here.
		</verse>
