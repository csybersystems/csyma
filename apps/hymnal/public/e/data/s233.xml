	<verses>
		<verse>
			Christ, whose glory fills the skies,
			Christ, the true, the only light,
			Sun of Righteousness, arise,
			triumph o'er the shades of night;
			Dayspring from on high, be near;
			Daystar, in my heart appear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Dark and cheerless is the morn
			unaccompanied by thee;
			joyless is the day's return,
			till thy mercy's beams I see;
			till they inward light impart,
			cheer my eyes and warm my heart.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Visit then this soul of mine;
			pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
			fill me, Radiancy divine,
			scatter all my unbelief;
			more and more thyself display,
			shining to the perfect day.
		</verse>
