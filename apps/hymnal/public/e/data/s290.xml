	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
			Look full in His wonderful face;
			And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
			In the light of His glory and grace.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			O soul, are you weary and troubled?
			No light in the darkness you see?
			There's light for a look at the Savior,
			And life more abundant and free!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Through death into life everlasting
			He passed, and we follow Him there;
			Over us sin no more hath dominion,
			For more than conqu'rors we are!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His word shall not fail you He promised;
			Believe Him and all will be well:
			Then go to a world that is dying,
			His perfect salvation to tell!
		</verse>
