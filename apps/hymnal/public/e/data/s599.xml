		<verse>
			Rejoice, rejoice, believers,
			And let your lights appear:
			The evening is advancing,
			And darker night is near.
			The Bridegroom is arising
			And soon He draweth nigh:
			Up, pray and watch and wrestle,
			At midnight comes the cry.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The watchers on the mountain
			Proclaim the Bridegroom near.
			Go, meet Him as He cometh,
			With hallelujahs clear.
			The marriage feast is waiting,
			The gates wide open stand;
			Up, up, you heirs of glory,
			The Bridegroom is at hand.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			You saints who here in patience
			Your cross and suff'rings bore,
			Shall live and reign forever,
			When sorrow is no more.
			Upon the throne  of glory
			The Lamb you shall behold,
			In triumph cast before Him
			Your diadems of gold.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Our hope and expectation,
			O Jesus, appear;
			Arise, O sun so longed for,
			O'er this benighted sphere!
			With hearts and hands uplifted,
			We plead, O Lord, to see
			The day of earth's redemption
			That brings us unto Thee.
