		<verse>
			Come, Thou almighty King,
			Help us Thy name to sing, Help us to praise!
			Father all glorious, O'er all victorious,
			Come, and reign over us, Ancient of Days!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, Thou incarnate Word,
			Gird on Thy mighty sword, Our prayer attend;
			Come, and Thy people bless,
			And give Thy Word success;
			Spirit of holiness, On us descend!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Come, holy Comforter,
			Thy sacred witness bear, In this glad hour:
			Thou who almighty art, Now rule in every heart,
			And ne'er from us depart, Spirit of power!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To Thee, great One in Thine,
			Eternal praises be, Hence, evermore:
			Thy sovereign majesty may we in glory see,
			And to eternity Love and adore!
