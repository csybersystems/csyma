	<verses>
		<verse>
			Come down, O Love divine, seek thou this soul of mine
			and visit it with thine own ardor glowing;
			O Comforter, draw near, within my heart appear,
			and kindle it, thy holy flame bestowing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O let it freely burn, till earthly passions turn
			to dust and ashes in its heat consuming;
			and let thy glorious light shine ever on my sight,
			and clothe me round, the while my path illuming.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let holy charity Mine outward vesture be,
					And lowliness become my inner clothing;
					True lowliness of heart which takes the humbler part,
					And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And so the yearning strong with which the soul will long
			shall far outpass the power of human telling;
			for none can guess its grace, till Love create a place
			wherein the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling.
		</verse>
