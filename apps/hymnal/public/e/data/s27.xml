		<verse>
			Rejoice ye pure in heart!
			Rejoice, give thanks, and sing;
			Your festal banner wave on high,
			The cross of Christ your King.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice,
			Give thanks and sing.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			With voice as full and strong
			As ocean's surging praise,
			Send forth the sturdy hymns of old,
			The psalms of ancient days.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			With all the angel choirs,
			With all the saints of earth,
			Pour out the strains of joy and bliss,
			True rapture, noblest mirth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yes, on through life's long path,
			Still chanting as ye go;
			From youth to age, by night and day,
			In gladness and in woe.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise Him who reigns on high,
			The Lord whom we adore,
			The Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
			One God forever more.
		</verse>
