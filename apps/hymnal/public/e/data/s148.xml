	<eTitle>O Love, How Deep, How Broad</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			O love, how deep, how broad, how high,
			Beyond all thought and fantasy,
			That God, the Son of God, should take
			Our mortal form for mortal's sake!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For us baptized, for us He bore
			His holy fast and hungered sore;
			For us temptation sharp He knew;
			For us the tempter over threw.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For us by wickedness betrayed,
			For us, in crown of thorns arrayed,
			He bore the shameful cross and death;
			For us He gave His dying breath.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For us He rose from death again,
			For us He went on high to reign;
			For us He sent His Spirit here
			To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All glory to our Lord and God
			For love so deep, so high, so broad;
			The Trinity whom we adore
			Forever and forevermore.
		</verse>
