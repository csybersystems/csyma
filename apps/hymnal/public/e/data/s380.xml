		<verse>
			Welcome, day of sweet repose!
			Blessed be thy sacred hours!
			We would trust the One who knows
			All our weak and failing powers.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Welcome, day in Eden born!
			Holy rest for sinless man!
			Like the dawning of fair morn
			Come thy hours to us again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Welcome, day blessed by our Lord!
			Toil shall cease and anxious care.
			Day commanded by His word,
			Day for song and praise and prayer.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Welcome, day our Savior kept!
			Keeping, wrought our righteousness,
			Day God bids us ne'er forget,
			Day of days His name to bless.
