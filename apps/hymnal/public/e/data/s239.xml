	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, priceless treasure,
			source of purest pleasure,
			truest friend to me,
			long my heart hath panted,
			till it well-nigh fainted,
			thirsting after thee.
			Thine I am, O spotless Lamb,
			I will suffer naught to hide thee,
			ask for naught beside thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			In thine arms I rest me;
			foes who would molest me
			cannot reach me here.
			Though the earth be shaking,
			every heart be quaking,
			Jesus calms our fear;
			sin and hell in conflict fell
			with their heaviest storms assail us;
			Jesus will not fail us.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Hence, all thoughts of sadness!
			For the Lord of gladness,
			Jesus, enters in.
			Those who love the Father,
			through the storms may gather,
			still have peace within;
			yea, whate'er we here must bear,
			still in thee lies purest pleasure,
			Jesus, priceless treasure!
		</verse>
