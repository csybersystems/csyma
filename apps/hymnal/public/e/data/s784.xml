	<eTitle>BLESSED IS THE MAN -- Psalm 1, RSV.</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Blessed is the man who walks not
			in the counsel of the wicked,
			nor stands in the way of sinners,
			nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			but his delight is in the law of the Lord,
			and on his law he meditates day and night.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He is like a tree planted by streams of water,
			that yields its fruit in its season,
			and its leaf does not wither.
			In all that he does, he prospers.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The wicked are not so,
			but are like chaff which the wind drives away.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
			nor sinners in the congn~galion or the righteous;
		</verse>
		<verse>
			for the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
			but the way of the wicked will perish.
		</verse>
