		<verse>
			There's a sweet, sweet spirit in this place,
			And I know that it's the spirit of the Lord;
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Sweet Holy Spirit, Sweet Heavenly Dove,
			Stay right here with us Filling us with Your love,
			And for these blessings we lift our hearts in praise,
			Without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived
			When we shall leave this place.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			There are sweet expressions on each face
			And I know they feel the presence of the Lord.
