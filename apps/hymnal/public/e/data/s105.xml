	<verses>
		<verse>
			Sing to the great Jehovah's praise!
			All praise to Him belongs;
			Who kindly lengthens out our days,
			Inspires our choicest songs,
			Inspires our choicest songs.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His providence hath brought us through
			Another various year;
			We all, with vows and anthems new,
			Before our God appear,
			Before our God appear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O God, Thy mercies past we own,
			And Thy continued care;
			To Thee presenting through Thy Son
			What e'er we have and are,
			What e'er we have and are.
		</verse>
