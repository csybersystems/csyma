	<verses>
		<verse>
			O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,
			On whom in affliction I call,
			My comfort by day and my song in the night,
			My hope, my salvation, my all!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,
			Is heard through the shadows of death;
			The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,
			The air is perfumed with His breath.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,
			To water the gardens of grace;
			From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
			And bask in the smiles of His face.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
			And myriads wait for His word;
			He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,
			Reechoes the praise of the Lord.
		</verse>
