	<eTitle>BOW DOWN YOUR EAR, O LORD, HEAR ME -- Psalm 86, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Bow down Your ear, O Lord, hear me;
			For I am poor and needy. . . .
			For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive,
			And abundant in mercy to all those
			who call upon You.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; 
			And attend to the voice of my supplications.
			In the day of my trouble I will call upon You, 
			For You will answer me. . . . 
			For You are great, and do wondrous things;
			You alone are God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Teach me Your way, O Lord;
			I will walk in Your truth;
			Unite my heart to fear Your name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I will praise You, O Lord my God,
			with all my heart,
			And I will glorify Your name forevermore. 
			For great is Your mercy toward me, 
			And You have delivered my soul
			from the depths of sheol.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O God, the proud have risen against me,
			And a mob of violent men have sought my life,
			And have not set You before them.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But You, 0 Lord, are a God full
			of compassion, and gracious,
			Longsuffering and abundant in
			mercy and truth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Oh, turn "to me, and have mercy on me! 
			Give Your strength to Your servant, 
			And save the son of Your maidservant.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Show me a sign for good,
			That those who hate me
			may see it and be ashamed,
			Because You, Lord, have helped me
			and comforted me.
		</verse>
