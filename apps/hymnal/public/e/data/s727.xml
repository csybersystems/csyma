	<eTitle>THE LORD IS MY LIGHT -- Psalm 27, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The Lord is my light and my salvation;
			Whom shall I fear?
			The Lord is the strength of my life;
			Of whom shall I be afraid?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When the wicked came against me
			To eat up my flesh,
			My enemies and foes,
			They stumbled and fell.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though an army should encamp against me,
			My heart shall not fear;
			Though war should rise against me,
			In this I will be confident.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			One thing I have desired of the Lord,
			That will I seek:
			That I may dwell in the house of the Lord
			All the days of my life,
			To behold the beauty of the Lord,
			And to inquire in His temple.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For in the time of trouble
			He shall hide me in His pavilion; 
			In the secret place of His tabernacle
			He shall hide me;
			He shall set me high upon a rock.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And now my head shall be lifted up
			above my enemies all around me;
			Therefore I will offer sacrifices of
			joy in His tabernacle; I will sing, yes,
			I will sing praises to the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When my father and my mother forsake me,
			Then the Lord will take care of me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Teach me Your way, 0 Lord,
			And lead me in a smooth path,
			because of my enemies.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Wait on the Lord; Be of good courage,
			And He shall strengthen your heart;
			Wait, I say, on the Lord!
		</verse>
