	<verses>
		<verse>
			By Christ redeemed, In Christ restored,
			We keep the memory adored,
			And show the death of our dear Lord,
			Until He come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His broken body in our stead Is here,
			In this memorial bread;
			And so our feeble love is fed,
			Until He come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			His fearful drops of agony,
			His life blood shed for us we see;
			The wine shall tell the mystery,
			Until He come.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And thus that dark betrayal night,
			With the last advent unite----
			The shame, the glory, by this rite,
			Until He come.
		</verse>
