	<verses>
		<verse>
			We three kings of Orient are;
			Bearing gifts we traverse afar
			Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
			Following yonder star.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			O star of wonder, star of night,
			Star with royal beauty bright,
			Westward leading, still proceeding,
			Guide us to Thy perfect light.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,
			Gold I bring to crown Him again,
			King forever, ceasing never
			Over us all to reign.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Frankincense to offer have I;
			Incense owns a Deity nigh;
			Prayer and praising all men raising,
			Worship Him, God on high.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume
			Breathes a life of gathering gloom:
			Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
			Sealed in the stonecold tomb.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Glorious now behold Him arise,
			King and God and sacrifice;
			Alleluia, Alleluia!
			Sounds through the earth and skies.
		</verse>
