	<verses>
		<verse>
			O Love that wilt not let me go,
			I rest my weary soul in thee;
			I give thee back the life I owe,
			that in thine ocean depths
			its flow may richer, fuller be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Light that followest all my way,
			I yield my flickering torch to thee;
			my heart restores its borrowed ray,
			that in they sunshine's blaze
			its day may brighter, fairer be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Joy that seekest me through pain,
			I cannot close my heart to thee;
			I trace the rainbow thru the rain,
			and feel the promise is not vain,
			that morn shall tearless be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Cross that liftest up my head,
			I dare not ask to fly from thee;
			I lay in dust life's glory dead,
			and from the ground there blossoms
			red life that shall endless be.
		</verse>
