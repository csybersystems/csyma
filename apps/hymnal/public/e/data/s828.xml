	<verses>
		<verse>
			Remember your Creator
			in the days of your youth,
			before the days of trouble come and
			the years approach when you will say,
			"I find no pleasure in them."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Even a child is known by his actions,
			by whether his conduct is pure and right.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			How can a young man keep his way pure?
			By living according to your word.
			I seek you with all my heart;
			do not let me stray from your commands.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			My son, do not forget my teaching,
			but keep my commands in your heart,
			for they will prolong your life
			many years and bring you prosperity.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let love and faithfulness never leave you;
			bind them around your neck,
			write them on the tablet of your heart.
			Then you will win favor and a good name
			in the sight of God and man.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Trust in the Lord with all your heart
			and lean not on your own understanding;
			in all your ways acknowledge him,
			and he will make your paths straight.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise the Lord, 0 my soul,
			and forget not all his benefits....
			He satisfies my desires with good things,
			so that my youth is renewed like the eagle's.
		</verse>
