	<verses>
		<verse>
			Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,
			And usher in the morning;
			Ye shepherds, shrink not with affright,
			But hear the angel's warning.
			This child, now weak in infancy
			Our confidence and joy shall be,
			The power of Satan breaking,
			Our peace eternal making.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,
			To herald our salvation;
			He stoops to earth the God of might,
			Our hope and expectation.
			He comes in human flesh to dwell,
			Our God with us, Immanuel,
			The night of darkness ending,
			Our fallen race be friending.
		</verse>
