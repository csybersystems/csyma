	<verses>
		<verse>
			Rise up, O men of God!
			His kingdom tarries long.
			Bring in the day of brotherhood
			And end the night of wrong.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let women all rise up!
			Have done with lesser things.
			Give heart and soul and mind and strength
			To serve the King of kings.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Rise up, courageous youth,
			The church for you doth wait,
			her strength unequal to her task;
			Rise up, and make her great!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lift high the cross of Christ!
			Tread where his feet have trod.
			Disciples of the Son of Man,
			Rise up, O church of God!
		</verse>
