		<refrain>
			Trust and obey, for there's no other way
			to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			When we walk with the Lord
			in the light of his word,
			what a glory he sheds on our way!
			While we do his good will,
			he abides with us still,
			and with all who will trust and obey.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Not a shadow can rise,
			Not a cloud in the skies,
			But His smile quickly drives it away;
			Not a doubt nor a fear,
			Not a sigh nor a tear,
			Can abide while we trust and obey
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Not a burden we bear,
			not a sorrow we share,
			but our toil he doth richly repay;
			not a grief or a loss,
			not a frown or a cross,
			but is blest if we trust and obey.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But we never can prove
			the delights of his love
			until all on the altar we lay;
			for the favor he shows,
			for the joy he bestows,
			are for them who will trust and obey.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then in fellowship sweet
			we will sit at his feet,
			or we'll walk by his side in the way;
			what he says we will do,
			where he sends we will go;
			never fear, only trust and obey.
		</verse>
