		<verse>
			We give this child to You,
			Our precious gift of love.
			Help us to lead each step aright
			With guidance from above.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O bless each child of Yours,
			And grant when they are grown,
			They will have learned to love Your way,
			And choose it for their own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We give ourselves to You,
			And may Your Spirit fill
			Our hearts and home, that all we do
			Be subject to Your will.
