		<verse>
			Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
			Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
			Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
			God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy, holy, holy! Angels adore Thee,
			Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea
			Thousands and ten thousands worship low before Thee, 
					Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,
			Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;
			Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
			Perfect in power, in love, and purity.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
			All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth, and sky, and sea;
			Holy, holy, holy; merciful and mighty!
			God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
		</verse>
