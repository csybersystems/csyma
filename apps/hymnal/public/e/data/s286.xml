		<verse>
			Sing them over again to me,
			wonderful words of life;
			let me more of their beauty see,
			wonderful words of life;
			words of life and beauty
			teach me faith and duty.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			Beautiful words, wonderful words,
			wonderful words of life.
			Beautiful words, wonderful words,
			wonderful words of life.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Christ, the blessed one, gives to all
			wonderful words of life;
			sinner, list to the loving call,
			wonderful words of life;
			all so freely given,
			wooing us to heaven.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sweetly echo the gospel call,
			wonderful words of life;
			offer pardon and peace to all,
			wonderful words of life;
			Jesus, only Savior,
			sanctify forever.
		</verse>
