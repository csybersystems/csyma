		<verse>
			Chief of sinners though I be,
			Jesus shed His blood for me;
			Died that I might live on high,
			Died that I might never die;
			As the brance is to the vine,
			I am His, and He is mine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O the height of Jesus' love!
			Higher than the heaven above,
			Deeper than the deepest sea,
			Lasting as eternity;
			Love that found me-wondrous thought!
			Found me when I sought Him not!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Chief of sinners though I be,
			Christ is all in all to me;
			All my wants to Him are known,
			All my sorrows are His own;
			Safe with Him from earthly strife,
			He sustains the hidden life.
		</verse>
