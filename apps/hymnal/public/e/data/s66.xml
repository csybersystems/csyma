	<verses>
		<verse>
			God be with you till we meet again;
			By His counsels guide, uphold you,
			With His sheep securely fold you:
			God be with you till we meet again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God be with you till we meet again;
			Neath His wings securely hide you,
			Daily manna still provide you:
			God be with you till we meet again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God be with you till we meet again;
			When life's perils thick confound you,
			Put His arms unfailing round you:
			God be with you till we meet again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			God be with you till we meet again;
			Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
			Smite death's threatening wave before you:
			God be with you till we meet again.
		</verse>
