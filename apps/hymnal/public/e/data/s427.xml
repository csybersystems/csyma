	<verses>
		<refrain>
			God shall "wipe away all tears;"
			There's no death, no pain, nor fears;
			And they count not time by years,
			For there is "no night there."
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			In the land of fadeless day
			Lies "the city four-square;"
			It shall never pass away,
			And there is "no night there."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			All the gates of pearl are made,
			In "the city four-square;"
			All the streets with gold are laid,
			And there is "no night there."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And the gates shall never close
			To "the city four-square;"
			There life's crystal river flows,
			And there is "no night there."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			There they need no sunshine bright,
			In "that city four-square;"
			For the Lamb is all the light,
			And there is "no night there."
		</verse>
