		<verse>
			We love Thy Sabbath, Lord,
			And worship at Thy will;
			Oh may these hours sweet peace afford
			And deeper faith instill.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thine angels sang for joy 
			Creation's work to see;
			We too, this day, would raise our hearts
			In grateful praise to Thee.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise for Thy wondrous love,
			That sealed this sacred day,
			A sign that all may understand
			We own Thy sovereign sway.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O great Creator King,
			Through Thy redeeming grace,
			Renew and sanctify our hearts
			That we may see Thy face.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And with the whiterobed throng,
			Upon Mount Sion be,
			And  joyful sing our Sabbath song
			Through all eternity.
