	<eTitle>DOING GOOD TO ALL -- Galatians 6, NIV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin,
			you who are spiritual should restore him gently.
			But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Carry each other's burdens, and in this way
			you will fulfill the law of Christ.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing,
			he deceives himself.
			Each one should test his own actions.
			Then he can take pride in himself,
			without comparing himself to some body else,
			for each one should carry his own load.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Anyone who receives instruction in the word
			must share all good things with his instructor.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Do not be deceived:
			God cannot be mocked.
			A man reaps what he sows.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The one who sows to please his sinful nature,
			from that nature will reap destruction;
			the one who sows to please the Spirit,
			from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let us not become weary in doing good,
			for at the proper time we will reap a 
			harvest if we do not give up.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Therefore, as we have opportunity,
			let us do good to all people,
			especially to those who belong
			to the family of believers.
		</verse>
