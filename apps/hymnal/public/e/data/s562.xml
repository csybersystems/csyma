	<verses>
		<verse>
			Come, sing a song of harvest,
			Of thanks for daily food!
			To offer God the first fruits
			Is old as gratitude.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Long, long ago, the reapers,
			Before they kept the feast,
			Put first-fruits in the basket,
			And took it to the priest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Shall we, sometimes forgetful
			Of where creation starts,
			With science in our pockets
			Lose wonder from our hearts?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			May God, the great creator,
			To whom all life belongs,
			Accept this gifts we offer,
			Our service and our songs.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And lest the world go hungry
			While we ourselves are fed,
			Make each of us more ready
			To share our daily bread.
		</verse>
