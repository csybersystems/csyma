		<verse>
			O Jesus, I have promised to serve thee to the end; 
			be thou forever near me, my Master and my friend. 
			I shall not fear the battle if thou art by my side, 
			nor wander from the pathway if thou wilt be my guide.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O let me feel thee near me! The world is ever near; 
			I see the sights that dazzle, the tempting sounds I hear; 
			my foes are ever near me, around me and within; 
			but Jesus, draw thou nearer, and shield my soul from sin.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Jesus, thou hast promised to all who follow thee 
			that where thou art in glory there shall thy servant be. 
			And Jesus, I have promised to serve thee to the end; 
			O give me grace to follow, my Master and my Friend.
