	<eTitle>SHOUT JOYFULLY TO THE LORD -- Psalm 1OO, NASB</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth.
			Serve the Lord with gladness; 
			Come before Him with joyful singing.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Know that the Lord Himself is God;
			It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves;
			We are His people and the sheep of His pasture.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Enter His gates with thanksgiving, 
			And His courts with praise.
			Give thanks to Him; bless His name.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the Lord is good;
			His loving kindness is everlasting, 
			And His faithfulness to all generations.
		</verse>
