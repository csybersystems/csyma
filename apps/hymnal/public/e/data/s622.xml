		<verse>
			Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear;
			But with joy wend your way.
			Though hard to you the journey may appear,
			Grace shall be as your day.
			We have a living Lord to guide,
			And we can trust Him to provide;
			Do this, and joy your hearts will swell:
			All is well! All is well!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We'll find the rest which God for us prepared,
			When at last He will call;
			Where none will come to hurt or make afraid,
			He will reign over all.
			We will make the air with music ring,
			Shout praise to God our Lord and King:
			O how we'll make the chorus swell:
			All is well! All is well!
		</verse>
