	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jerusalem, my happy home,
			O how I long for thee!
			When will my sorrows have an end,
			The joys when shall I see?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The walls are all of precious stone,
			Most glorious to behold;
			Thy gates are richly set with pearl,
			Thy streets are paved with gold.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thy garden and thy pleasant walks
			My study long have been;
			Such dazzling views by human sight
			Have never yet been seen.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Lord, help us by Thy mighty grace,
			To keep in view the prize,
			Till Thou dost come to take us home
			To that blessed paradise.
		</verse>
