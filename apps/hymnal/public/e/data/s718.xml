	<eTitle>REJOICE IN THE LORD -- Psalm 33, NKJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Rejoice in the Lord, 0 you righteous!
			For praise from the upright is beautiful.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise the Lord with the harp;
			Make melody to Him with an
			instrument of ten strings.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Sing to Him a new song;
			Play skillfully with a shout of joy.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the word of the Lord is right,
			And all His work is done in truth.
			He loves righteousness and justice;
			The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,
			And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.
			He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap;
			He lays up the deep in storehouses.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let all the earth fear the Lord;
			Let all the inhabitants of the world
			stand in awe of Him.
			For He spoke, and it was done;
			He commanded, and it stood fast.
		</verse>
