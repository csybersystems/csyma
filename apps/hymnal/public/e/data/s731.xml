	<eTitle>THE VISIT OF THE WISE MEN -- Matthew 2, RSV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea
			in the days of Herod the king, behold,
			wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews?
			For we have seen his star in the East,
			and have come to worship him."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When Herod the king heard this, 
			he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;
			and assembling all the chief priests 
			and scribes of the people,
			he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea;
			for so it is written by the prophet:
			'And you, 0 Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
			are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;
			for from you shall come a ruler 
			who will govern my people Israel.'"
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly
			and ascertained from them
			what time the star appeared;
			and he sent them to Bethlehem, saying,
			"Go and search diligently for the child,
			and when you have found him bring me word,
			that I too may come and worship him."
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When they had heard the king they went their way;
			and lo, the star which they had seen in the East
			went before them,
			till it came to rest over the place
			where the child was.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When they saw the star, they rejoiced
			exceedingly with great joy;
			and going into the house they saw
			the child with Mary his mother,
			and they fell down and worshiped him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then, opening their treasures,
			they offered him gifts,
			gold and frankincense and myrrh.
