		<verse>
			Blest be the tie that binds
			our hearts in Christian love;
			the fellowship of kindred minds
			is like to that above.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Before our Father's throne
			we pour our ardent prayers;
			our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
			our comforts and our cares.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We share each other's woes,
			our mutual burdens bear; 
			and often for each other flows
			the sympathizing tear.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			When we asunder part,
			it gives us inward pain;
			but we shall still be joined in heart,
			and hope to meet again.
		</verse>
