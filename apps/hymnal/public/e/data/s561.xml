	<verses>
		<refrain>
			All good gifts around us
			Are sent from Heav'n above,
			Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord,
			For all His love.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			We plow the fields, and scatter
			The good seed on the land,
			But it is fed and water'd
			By God's Almighty Hand;
			He sends the snow in winter,
			The warmth to swell the grain,
			The breezes, and the sunshine,
			And soft refreshing rain.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He only is the Maker
			Of all things near and far;
			He paints the wayside flower,
			He lights the evening star;
			The winds and waves obey Him,
			By Him the birds are fed;
			Much more to us, His children,
			He gives our daily bread.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We thank Thee then, O Father,
			For all things bright and good,
			The seed-time and the harvest,
			Our life, our health, our food;
			Accept the gifts we offer
			For all Thy love imparts,
			And, what Thou most desirest,
			Our humble, thankful hearts.
		</verse>
