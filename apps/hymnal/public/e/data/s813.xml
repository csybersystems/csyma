	<eTitle>LORD, WHO MAY DWELL IN YOUR SANCTUARY? -- Psalm 15, NJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord, who may dwell in your sanctuary?
			Who may live on your holy hill?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He whose walk is blameless
			and who does what is righteous,
			who speaks the truth from his heart and
			has no slander on his tongue,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			who does his neighbor no wrong and casts
			no slur on his fellow man,
			who despises a vile man
			but honors those who fear the Lord,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			who keeps his oath even when it hurts,
			who lends his money without usury and 
			does not accept a bribe against the innocent.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He who does these things will never be shaken.
		</verse>
