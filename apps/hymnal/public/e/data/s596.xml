		<refrain>
			Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic waymarks,
			Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four.
			Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic waymarks;
			The journey's almost o'er.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Look for the waymarks as you journey on,
			Look for the waymarks, passing one by one;
			Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four---
			Where are we standing? Look the waymarks o'er.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,
			Then Medo-Persia's banners were unfurled;
			And after Greece held universal sway,
			Rome seized the scepter---Where are we today?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Down in the feet of iron and of clay,
			Weak and divided, soon to pass away;
			What will the next great, glorious drama be?
			Christ and His coming, and eternity.
		</verse>
