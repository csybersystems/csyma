	<verses>
		<verse>
			Shepherd of tender youth,
			Guiding in love and truth,
			Through devious ways;
			Christ our triumphant King,
			We come Thy name to sing,
			Hither our children bring
			To shout Thy praise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou art our holy Lord,
			The all subduing Word,
			Healer of strife;
			Thou didst Thyself abase,
			That from sin's deep disgrace
			Thou mightiest save our race,
			And give us life.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou art the great High Priest;
			Thou hast prepared the feast
			Of heavenly love;
			While in our mortal pain
			None calls on Thee in vain;
			Help Thou dost not disdain,
			Help from above.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Ever be Thou guide,
			Our Shepherd and our pride,
			Our staff and song;
			Jesus, Thou Christ of God,
			By Thy perennial word,
			Lead us where Thou has trod,
			Make our faith strong.
		</verse>
