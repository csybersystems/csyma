		<verse>
			Once to every man and nation
			Comes the moment to decide,
			In the strife of truth with falsehood,
			For the good or evil side;
			Some great cause, God's new Messiah,
			Offering each the bloom or blight,
			And the choice goes by forever
			'Twixt that darkness and that light.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then to side with truth is noble
			When we share her wretched crust,
			Ere her cause bring fame and profit,
			And 'tis prosperous to be just;
			Then it is the brave man chooses,
			While the coward stands aside,
			Till the multitude make virtue
			Of the faith they had denied.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			By the light of burning martyrs,
			Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,
			Toiling up new Calvaries ever
			With the cross that turns not back;
			New occasions teach new duties,
			Time makes ancient good uncouth;
			They must upward still and onward,
			Who would keep abreast of truth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Though the cause of evil prosper,
			Yet 'tis truth alone is strong;
			Though her portion be the scaffold,
			And upon the throne be wrong;
			Yet the scaffold sways the future,
			And, behind the dim unknown,
			Standeth God within the shadow,
			Keeping watch above His own.
