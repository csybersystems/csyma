		<refrain>
			In the sweet by and by,
			We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
			In the sweet by and by,
			We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			There's a land that is fairer than day,
			And by faith we can see it afar;
			For the Father waits over the way,
			To prepare us a dwelling place there.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We shall sing on that beautiful shore
			The melodious songs of the blest,
			And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
			Not a sigh for the blessings of rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			To our bountiful Father above,
			We will offer a tribute of praise,
			For the glorious gift of His love,
			And the blessings that hallow our days.
		</verse>
