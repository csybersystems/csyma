	<verses>
		<verse>
			Teach what befits sound doctrine.
			Bid the. older men be temperate, serious,
			sensible, sound in faith, in love,
			and in steadfastness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Bid the older women likewise
			to be reverent in behavior,	
			not to be slanderers or slaves to drink;
			they are to teach what is good,
			and so train the young women 
			to love their husbands and children....
			Likewise urge the younger men
			to control themselves.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler;
			and whoever is led astray by it is not wise.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
			Who has strife? Who has complaining?
			Who has wounds without cause?
			Who has redness of eyes?
			Those who tarry long over wine,
			those who go to try mixed wine.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Do not look at wine when it is red,
			when it sparkles in the cup
			and goes down smoothly.	
			At the last it bites like a serpent,
			and stings like an adder.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Every athlete exercises self-control in all things.
			They do it to receive a perishable wreath,
			but we an imperishable.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the grace of God has appeared
			for the salvation of all men,	
			training us to renounce irreligion
			and worldly passions,	
			and to live sober, upright,
			and godly lives in this world,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			awaiting our blessed hope,
			the appearing of the glory
			Of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.
