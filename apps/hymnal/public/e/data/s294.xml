	<verses>
		<verse>
			Would you be free from the burden of sin?
			There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
			Would you o'er evil a victory win?
			There's wonderful power in the blood.
		</verse>
		<refrain>
			There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder working pow'r
			In the blood of the Lamb;
			There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder working pow'r
			In the precious blood of the Lamb.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Would be free from your passion and pride?
			There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
			Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide?
			There's wonderful power in the blood.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Would you do service for Jesus your King?
			There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;
			Would you live daily His praises to sing?
			There's wonderful power in the blood.
		</verse>
