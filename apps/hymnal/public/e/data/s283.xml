	<verses>
		<verse>
			O Jesus, Thou art standing
			Outside the fast closed door,
			In lowly patience waiting
			To pass the threshold o'r:
			O shame, professing Christian,
			His name and sign who bear,
			O shame, thrice shame upon us,
			To keep Him standing there!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Jesus, Thou art knocking;
			And, lo, that hand is scarred,
			And thorns Thy brow encircle,
			And tears Thy face have marred.
			O love that passeth knowledge,
			So patiently to wait!
			O sin that hath no equal,
			So fast to bar the gate!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Jesus, Thou art pleading
			In accents meek and low,
			"I died for you, My children,
			And will ye treat Me so?"
			O Lord, with shame and sorrow
			We open now the door;
			Dear Savior, enter, enter,
			And leave us never more.
		</verse>
