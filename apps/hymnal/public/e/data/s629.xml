		<verse>
			O happy band of pilgrims,
			If onward ye will tread
			With Jesus as your fellow,
			To Jesus as your Head!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O happy if ye labor 
			As Jesus did for men;
			O happy if ye hunger
			As Jesus hungered then!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The trials that beset you,
			The sorrows ye endure,
			The manifold temptations
			That death alone can cure,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			What are they but His jewels
			Of right celestial worth?
			What are they but the ladder
			Set up to heaven on earth?
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O happy band of pilgrims,
			Look upward to the skies,
			Where such a light affliction
			Shall win you such a prize!
		</verse>
