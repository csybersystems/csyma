	<verses>
		<verse>
			Alleluia!
			Let heaven praise Yahweh:
			praise him, heavenly heights,
			praise him, all his angels,
			praise him, all his armies!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise him, sun and moon,
			praise him, shining stars,
			praise him, highest heavens,
			and waters above the heavens!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let them all praise the name of Yahweh,
			at whose command they were created;
			he has fixed them in their place for ever,
			by an unalterable statute.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let earth praise Yahweh:
			sea-monsters and all the deeps,
			fire and hail, snow and mist,
			gales that obey his decree,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			mountains and hills, orchards and forests,
			wild animals and farm animals, snakes and birds,
		</verse>
		<verse>
			all kings on earth and nations,
			princes, all rulers in the world,
			young men and girls,
			old people, and children too!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Let them all praise the name of Yahweh,
			for his name and no other is sublime,
			transcending earth and heaven in majesty,
			raising the fortunes of his people,
			to the praises of the devout,
			of Israel, the people dear to him.
		</verse>
