	<verses>
		<verse>
			Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
			in living echoes of thy tone;
			as thou has sought, so let me seek 
			Thy erring children lost and lone.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O lead me, Lord, that I may lead
			the wandering and the wavering feet;
			O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
			thy hungering ones with manna sweet.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O strengthen me, that while I stand
			firm on the rock, and strong in thee,
			I may stretch out a loving hand
			to wrestlers with the troubled sea.
		</verse>
