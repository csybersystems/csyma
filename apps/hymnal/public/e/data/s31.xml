		<verse>
			Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord:
			Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;
			Tender to me the promise of His word;
			In God my Savior shall my heart rejoice.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name:
			Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done;
			His mercy sure, from age to age the same;
			His holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might:
			Pow'rs and dominions lay their glory by;
			Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,
			The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word:
			Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.
			Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord
			To children's children and forever more.
		</verse>
