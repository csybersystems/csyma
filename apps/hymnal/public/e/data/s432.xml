	<eTitle>Shall We Gather at the River</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<refrain>
			Yes, we'll gather at the river,
			the beautiful, the beautiful river;
			gather with the saints at the river
			that flows by the throne of God.
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			Shall we gather at the river,
			where bright angel feet have trod,
			with its crystal tide forever
			flowing by the throne of God.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			On the margin of the river
			washing up its silver spray,
			we will walk and worship ever,
			all the happy golden day.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Ere we reach the shining river,
			lay we ev'ry burden down;
			grace our spirits will deliver,
			and provide a robe and crown.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Soon we'll reach the shining river,
			soon our pilgrimage will cease;
			soon our happy hearts will quiver
			with the melody of peace.
		</verse>
