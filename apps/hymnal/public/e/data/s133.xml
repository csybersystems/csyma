		<refrain>
			Now is born the divine Christ child,
			Play the musette, play the tuneful oboe,
			Now is born the divine Christ child,
			Sing we all and rejoice this day.

		<verse>
			He was born in a stable bare,
			On bed of straw how He sleeps so soundly,
			He was born in a stable bare,
			Let us worship and to Him bow.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Ages long since are past and gone,
			When the wise men foretold His coming,
			Ages long since are past and gone,
			When the wise men foretold His birth.
