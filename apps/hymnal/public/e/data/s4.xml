		<verse>
			Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;
			To His feet thy tribute bring.
			Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
			Who like thee His praise should sing?
			Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia,
			Praise the everlasting King.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Praise Him for His grace and favor
			To our fathers in distress.
			Praise Him, still the same forever,
			Slow to chide and swift to bless;
			Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia,
			Glorious in His faithfulness.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Tenderly He shields and spares us;
			Well our feeble frame He knows.
			In His hands He gently bears us,
			Rescues us from all our foes.
			Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia,
			Widely as His mercy flows.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Angels, help us to adore Him:
			Ye behold Him face to face;
			Sun and moon, bow down before Him:
			Dwellers all in time and space.
			Praise Him, praise Him, Alleluia,
			Praise with us the God of grace.
		</verse>
