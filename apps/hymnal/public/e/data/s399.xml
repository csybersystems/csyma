		<verse>
			Beneath the forms of outward rite
			Thy supper, Lord, is spread
			In every quiet upper room
			Where fainting souls are fed.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The bread is always consecrate
			Which men divide with men;
			And every act of brotherhood
			Repeats Thy feast again.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			The blessed cup is only passed
			True memory of Thee,
			When life anew pours out its wine
			With rich sufficiency.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Master, through these symbols shared,
			Thine own dear self impart,
			That in our daily life may flame
			The passion of Thy heart.
		</verse>
