	<verses>
		<verse>
			Jesus, the very thought of thee
			with sweetness fills the breast;
			but sweeter far thy face to see,
			and in thy presence rest.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
			Nor can the memory find
			A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,
			The Savior of mankind.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O hope of every contrite heart!
			O joy of all the meek,
			to those who fall, how kind thou art!
			How good to those who seek!
		</verse>
		<verse>
			But what to those who find? Ah, this
			nor tongue nor pen can show;
			the love of Jesus, what it is,
			none but his loved ones know.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Jesus, our only joy be thou,
			as thou our prize wilt be;
			Jesus, be thou our glory now,
			and through eternity.
		</verse>
