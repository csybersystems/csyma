	<verses>
		<verse>
			Come, ye thankful people, come,
			Raise the song of harvest home;
			All is safely gathered in,
			Ere the winter storms begin.
			God, our Maker, doth provide
			For our wants to be supplied;
			Come to God's own temple, come,
			Raise the song of harvest home.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			We ourselves are God's own field,
			Fruit unto His praise to yield;
			Wheat and tares together sown
			Unto to joy or sorrow grown;
			first the blade and then the ear,
			then the full corn shall appear;
			Grant of harvest Lord that we
			wholesome grain and pure may be.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			For the Lord our God shall come,
			and shall take His harvest home;
			from His field shall purge away,
			All that doth offend that day,
			give His angels charge at last
			in the fire the tares to cast;
			but the fruitful ears to store
			in His garner evermore.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Then, Thou church triumphant come,
			Raise the song of harvest home,
			All are safely gathered in,
			Free from sorrow, free from sin,
			there, forever purified,
			In God`s garner to abide;
			Come, ten thousand angels, come,
			Raise the glorious harvest home.
		</verse>
