	<verses>
		<verse>
			Blessed be God the Father of our
			Lord Jesus Christ,	
			who has blessed us with all the
			spiritual blessings of heaven in Christ.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Before the world was made,
			he chose us, chose us in Christ,
			to be holy and spodess,
			and to live through love in his presence,
			determining that we should become
			his adopted sons, through Jesus Christ
			for his own kind purposes,
			to make us praise the glory of his grace,
			his free gift to us in the Beloved,
			in whom, through his blood,
			we gain our freedom, the forgiveness of our sins.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Such is the richness of the grace 
			which he has showered on us
			in all wisdom and insight.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He has let us know the mystery of his purpose,
			the hidden plan he so kindly made  in Christ
			from the beginning to act upon
			when the times had run their course to the end:
			that he would bring everything
			together under Christ, as head,
			everything in the heavens and
			everything on earth.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			And it is in him that we were claimed as God's own,
			chosen from the beginning,
			under the predetermined plan of the one
			who guides all things as he decides by his own will;
			chosen to be, for his greater glory,
			the people who would put their
			hopes in Christ before he came.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Now you too, in him, have heard the message
			of the truth and the good news of your salvation,
			and have believed it;	
			and you too have been stamped with the seal
			of the Holy Spirit of the Promise,
			the pledge of our inheritance which brings freedom
			for those whom God has taken for his own,
			to make his glory praised.
		</verse>
