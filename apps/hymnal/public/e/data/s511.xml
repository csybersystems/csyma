		<refrain>
			But "I know whom I have believed,
			And ampersuaded that He is able
			To keep that which I've committed
			Unto Him against that day."
		</refrain>
		<verse>
			I know not why God's wondrous grace
			To me He hath made known,
			Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
			Redeemed me for His own.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I know not how this saving faith
			To me He did impart,
			Nor how believing in His word
			Wrought peace within my heart.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I know not how the Spirit moves,
			Convincing men of sin,
			Revealing Jesus through the word,
			Creating faith in Him.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			I know not when my Lord may come,
			At night or noon-day fair,
			Now if I walk the vale with Him,
			Or meet Him in the air.
		</verse>
