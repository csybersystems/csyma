	<verses>
		<verse>
			My soul, be on thy guard!
			Ten thousand foes arise;
			The hosts of sin are pressing hard
			To draw thee from the skies.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O watch, and fight, and pray!
			The battle ne'er give o'er;
			Renew it boldly every day,
			And help divine implore.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Ne'er think the victory won,
			Nor lay thine armor down;
			Thy arduous task will not be done
			Till thou obtain the crown.
		</verse>
