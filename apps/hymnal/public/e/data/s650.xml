	<verses>
		<verse>
			Our Father, by whose name,
			All fatherhood is known,
			Who dost in love proclaim
			Each family Thine own,
			Bless Thou all parents, guarding well,
			With constant love as sentinel,
			The homes in which Thy people dwell.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Christ, Thyself a child
			Within an earthly home,
			With heart still undefiled,
			Thou didst to manhood come;
			Our children bless, in every place,
			That they may all behold Thy face,
			And knowing Thee may grow in grace.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			O Spirit, who dost bind
			Our hearts in unity,
			Who teaches us to find
			The love from self set free,
			In all our hearts such love increase,
			That every home, by this release,
			May be dwelling place of peace.
		</verse>
