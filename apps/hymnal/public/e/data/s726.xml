	<eTitle>THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD -- Psalm 23, KJV</eTitle>
	<verses>
		<verse>
			The Lord is my shepherd;
			I shall not want.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
			he leadeth me beside the still waters.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			He restoreth my soul:
			he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
			for his name's sake.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Yea, though I walk through the
			valley of the shadow of death,
			I will fear no evil:
			for thou art with me;
			thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Thou preparest a table before me
			in the presence of mine enemies:
			thou anointest my head with oil;
			my cup runneth over.
		</verse>
		<verse>
			Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
			all the days of my life:
			and I will dwell in the house of the
			Lord for ever.
		</verse>
